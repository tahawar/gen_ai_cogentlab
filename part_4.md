# Part 4

## Chapter 1

Can this be still a dream?’v Raskolnikov thought once 
more.
He looked carefully and suspiciously at the unexpected 
visitor.
‘Svidrigaïlov! What nonsense! It can’t be!’ he said at last 
aloud in bewilderment.
His visitor did not seem at all surprised at this exclama -
tion.
‘I’ve come to you for two reasons. In the first place, I want -
ed to make your personal acquaintance, as I have already 
heard a great deal about you that is interesting and flatter -
ing; secondly, I cherish the hope that you may not refuse to 
assist me in a matter directly concerning the welfare of your 
sister, Avdotya Romanovna. For without your support she 
might not let me come near her now, for she is prejudiced 
against me, but with your assistance I reckon on …’
‘You reckon wrongly,’ interrupted Raskolnikov.
‘They only arrived yesterday, may I ask you?’
Raskolnikov made no reply.
‘It was yesterday, I know. I only arrived myself the day 
before. Well, let me tell you this, Rodion Romanovitch, I 
don’t consider it necessary to justify myself, but kindly tell 
me what was there particularly criminal on my part in all 
this business, speaking without prejudice, with common
Crime and Punishment sense?’
Raskolnikov continued to look at him in silence.
‘That in my own house I persecuted a defenceless girl and 
‘insulted her with my infamous proposals’—is that it? (I am 
anticipating you.) But you’ve only to assume that I, too, am 
a man et nihil humanum  … in a word, that I am capable of 
being attracted and falling in love (which does not depend 
on our will), then everything can be explained in the most 
natural manner. The question is, am I a monster, or am I 
myself a victim? And what if I am a victim? In proposing 
to the object of my passion to elope with me to America or 
Switzerland, I may have cherished the deepest respect for 
her and may have thought that I was promoting our mutual 
happiness! Reason is the slave of passion, you know; why, 
probably, I was doing more harm to myself than anyone!’
‘But that’s not the point,’ Raskolnikov interrupted with 
disgust. ‘It’s simply that whether you are right or wrong, we 
dislike you. We don’t want to have anything to do with you. 
We show you the door. Go out!’
Svidrigaïlov broke into a sudden laugh.
‘But you’re … but there’s no getting round you,’ he said, 
laughing in the frankest way. ‘I hoped to get round you, but 
you took up the right line at once!’
‘But you are trying to get round me still!’
‘What of it? What of it?’ cried Svidrigaïlov, laughing 
openly. ‘But this is what the French call bonne guerre  and 
the most innocent form of deception! … But still you have 
interrupted me; one way or another, I repeat again: there 
would never have been any unpleasantness except for what Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comhappened in the garden. Marfa Petrovna …’
‘You have got rid of Marfa Petrovna, too, so they say?’ 
Raskolnikov interrupted rudely.
‘Oh, you’ve heard that, too, then? You’d be sure to, 
though…. But as for your question, I really don’t know what 
to say, though my own conscience is quite at rest on that 
score. Don’t suppose that I am in any apprehension about it. 
All was regular and in order; the medical inquiry diagnosed 
apoplexy due to bathing immediately after a heavy dinner 
and a bottle of wine, and indeed it could have proved noth -
ing else. But I’ll tell you what I have been thinking to myself 
of late, on my way here in the train, especially: didn’t I con -
tribute to all that … calamity, morally, in a way, by irritation 
or something of the sort. But I came to the conclusion that 
that, too, was quite out of the question.’
Raskolnikov laughed.
‘I wonder you trouble yourself about it!’
‘But what are you laughing at? Only consider, I struck her 
just twice with a switch—there were no marks even … don’t 
regard me as a cynic, please; I am perfectly aware how atro -
cious it was of me and all that; but I know for certain, too, 
that Marfa Petrovna was very likely pleased at my, so to say, 
warmth. The story of your sister had been wrung out to the 
last drop; for the last three days Marfa Petrovna had been 
forced to sit at home; she had nothing to show herself with 
in the town. Besides, she had bored them so with that letter 
(you heard about her reading the letter). And all of a sud -
den those two switches fell from heaven! Her first act was 
to order the carriage to be got out…. Not to speak of the
Crime and Punishment 00fact that there are cases when women are very, very glad to 
be insulted in spite of all their show of indignation. There 
are instances of it with everyone; human beings in general, 
indeed, greatly love to be insulted, have you noticed that? 
But it’s particularly so with women. One might even say it’s 
their only amusement.’
At one time Raskolnikov thought of getting up and walk -
ing out and so finishing the interview. But some curiosity 
and even a sort of prudence made him linger for a moment.
‘You are fond of fighting?’ he asked carelessly.
‘No, not very,’ Svidrigaïlov answered, calmly. ‘And Marfa 
Petrovna and I scarcely ever fought. We lived very harmo -
niously, and she was always pleased with me. I only used 
the whip twice in all our seven years (not counting a third 
occasion of a very ambiguous character). The first time, 
two months after our marriage, immediately after we ar -
rived in the country, and the last time was that of which we 
are speaking. Did you suppose I was such a monster, such 
a reactionary, such a slave driver? Ha, ha! By the way, do 
you remember, Rodion Romanovitch, how a few years ago, 
in those days of beneficent publicity, a nobleman, I’ve for -
gotten his name, was put to shame everywhere, in all the 
papers, for having thrashed a German woman in the rail -
way train. You remember? It was in those days, that very 
year I believe, the ‘disgraceful action of the Age’ took place 
(you know, ‘The Egyptian Nights,’ that public reading, you 
remember? The dark eyes, you know! Ah, the golden days of 
our youth, where are they?). Well, as for the gentleman who 
thrashed the German, I feel no sympathy with him, because
01 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comafter all what need is there for sympathy? But I must say 
that there are sometimes such provoking ‘Germans’ that I 
don’t believe there is a progressive who could quite answer 
for himself. No one looked at the subject from that point of 
view then, but that’s the truly humane point of view, I as -
sure you.’
After saying this, Svidrigaïlov broke into a sudden laugh 
again. Raskolnikov saw clearly that this was a man with a 
firm purpose in his mind and able to keep it to himself.
‘I expect you’ve not talked to anyone for some days?’ he 
asked.
‘Scarcely anyone. I suppose you are wondering at my be -
ing such an adaptable man?’
‘No, I am only wondering at your being too adaptable a 
man.’
‘Because I am not offended at the rudeness of your ques -
tions? Is that it? But why take offence? As you asked, so I 
answered,’ he replied, with a surprising expression of sim -
plicity. ‘You know, there’s hardly anything I take interest in,’ 
he went on, as it were dreamily, ‘especially now, I’ve nothing 
to do…. You are quite at liberty to imagine though that I am 
making up to you with a motive, particularly as I told you 
I want to see your sister about something. But I’ll confess 
frankly, I am very much bored. The last three days especial -
ly, so I am delighted to see you…. Don’t be angry, Rodion 
Romanovitch, but you seem to be somehow awfully strange 
yourself. Say what you like, there’s something wrong with 
you, and now, too … not this very minute, I mean, but now, 
generally…. Well, well, I won’t, I won’t, don’t scowl! I am
Crime and Punishment 0not such a bear, you know, as you think.’
Raskolnikov looked gloomily at him.
‘You are not a bear, perhaps, at all,’ he said. ‘I fancy in -
deed that you are a man of very good breeding, or at least 
know how on occasion to behave like one.’
‘I am not particularly interested in anyone’s opin -
ion,’ Svidrigaïlov answered, dryly and even with a shade 
of haughtiness, ‘and therefore why not be vulgar at times 
when vulgarity is such a convenient cloak for our climate … 
and especially if one has a natural propensity that way,’ he 
added, laughing again.
‘But I’ve heard you have many friends here. You are, as 
they say, ‘not without connections.’ What can you want 
with me, then, unless you’ve some special object?’
‘That’s true that I have friends here,’ Svidrigaïlov admit -
ted, not replying to the chief point. ‘I’ve met some already. 
I’ve been lounging about for the last three days, and I’ve 
seen them, or they’ve seen me. That’s a matter of course. I 
am well dressed and reckoned not a poor man; the emanci -
pation of the serfs hasn’t affected me; my property consists 
chiefly of forests and water meadows. The revenue has not 
fallen off; but … I am not going to see them, I was sick of 
them long ago. I’ve been here three days and have called on 
no one…. What a town it is! How has it come into existence 
among us, tell me that? A town of officials and students of 
all sorts. Yes, there’s a great deal I didn’t notice when I was 
here eight years ago, kicking up my heels…. My only hope 
now is in anatomy, by Jove, it is!’
‘Anatomy?’
0 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com‘But as for these clubs, Dussauts, parades, or progress, 
indeed, maybe —well, all that can go on without me,’ he 
went on, again without noticing the question. ‘Besides, who 
wants to be a card-sharper?’
‘Why, have you been a card-sharper then?’
‘How could I help being? There was a regular set of us, 
men of the best society, eight years ago; we had a fine time. 
And all men of breeding, you know, poets, men of property. 
And indeed as a rule in our Russian society the best manners 
are found among those who’ve been thrashed, have you no -
ticed that? I’ve deteriorated in the country. But I did get into 
prison for debt, through a low Greek who came from Ne -
zhin. Then Marfa Petrovna turned up; she bargained with 
him and bought me off for thirty thousand silver pieces (I 
owed seventy thousand). We were united in lawful wedlock 
and she bore me off into the country like a treasure. You 
know she was five years older than I. She was very fond of 
me. For seven years I never left the country. And, take note, 
that all my life she held a document over me, the IOU for 
thirty thousand roubles, so if I were to elect to be restive 
about anything I should be trapped at once! And she would 
have done it! Women find nothing incompatible in that.’
‘If it hadn’t been for that, would you have given her the 
slip?’
‘I don’t know what to say. It was scarcely the document 
restrained me. I didn’t want to go anywhere else. Mar -
fa Petrovna herself invited me to go abroad, seeing I was 
bored, but I’ve been abroad before, and always felt sick 
there. For no reason, but the sunrise, the bay of Naples, the
Crime and Punishment 0sea—you look at them and it makes you sad. What’s most 
revolting is that one is really sad! No, it’s better at home. 
Here at least one blames others for everything and excuses 
oneself. I should have gone perhaps on an expedition to the 
North Pole, because j’ai le vin mauvais  and hate drinking, 
and there’s nothing left but wine. I have tried it. But, I say, 
I’ve been told Berg is going up in a great balloon next Sun -
day from the Yusupov Garden and will take up passengers 
at a fee. Is it true?’
‘Why, would you go up?’
‘I … No, oh, no,’ muttered Svidrigaïlov really seeming to 
be deep in thought.
‘What does he mean? Is he in earnest?’ Raskolnikov won -
dered.
‘No, the document didn’t restrain me,’ Svidrigaïlov went 
on, meditatively. ‘It was my own doing, not leaving the 
country, and nearly a year ago Marfa Petrovna gave me back 
the document on my name- day and made me a present of 
a considerable sum of money, too. She had a fortune, you 
know. ‘You see how I trust you, Arkady Ivanovitch’— that 
was actually her expression. You don’t believe she used it? 
But do you know I managed the estate quite decently, they 
know me in the neighbourhood. I ordered books, too. Mar -
fa Petrovna at first approved, but afterwards she was afraid 
of my over-studying.’
‘You seem to be missing Marfa Petrovna very much?’
‘Missing her? Perhaps. Really, perhaps I am. And, by the 
way, do you believe in ghosts?’
‘What ghosts?’
0 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com‘Why, ordinary ghosts.’
‘Do you believe in them?’
‘Perhaps not, pour vous plaire …. I wouldn’t say no ex -
actly.’
‘Do you see them, then?’
Svidrigaïlov looked at him rather oddly.
‘Marfa Petrovna is pleased to visit me,’ he said, twisting 
his mouth into a strange smile.
‘How do you mean ‘she is pleased to visit you’?’
‘She has been three times. I saw her first on the very day 
of the funeral, an hour after she was buried. It was the day 
before I left to come here. The second time was the day be -
fore yesterday, at daybreak, on the journey at the station of 
Malaya Vishera, and the third time was two hours ago in 
the room where I am staying. I was alone.’
‘Were you awake?’
‘Quite awake. I was wide awake every time. She comes, 
speaks to me for a minute and goes out at the door—always 
at the door. I can almost hear her.’
‘What made me think that something of the sort must be 
happening to you?’ Raskolnikov said suddenly.
At the same moment he was surprised at having said it. 
He was much excited.
‘What! Did you think so?’ Svidrigaïlov asked in astonish -
ment. ‘Did you really? Didn’t I say that there was something 
in common between us, eh?’
‘You never said so!’ Raskolnikov cried sharply and with 
heat.
‘Didn’t I?’
Crime and Punishment 0‘No!’
‘I thought I did. When I came in and saw you lying with 
your eyes shut, pretending, I said to myself at once, ‘Here’s 
the man.’’
‘What do you mean by ‘the man?’ What are you talking 
about?’ cried Raskolnikov.
‘What do I mean? I really don’t know….’ Svidrigaïlov 
muttered ingenuously, as though he, too, were puzzled.
For a minute they were silent. They stared in each other’s 
faces.
‘That’s all nonsense!’ Raskolnikov shouted with vexation. 
‘What does she say when she comes to you?’
‘She! Would you believe it, she talks of the silliest trifles 
and—man is a strange creature—it makes me angry. The 
first time she came in (I was tired you know: the funeral 
service, the funeral ceremony, the lunch afterwards. At last 
I was left alone in my study. I lighted a cigar and began to 
think), she came in at the door. ‘You’ve been so busy to-day, 
Arkady Ivanovitch, you have forgotten to wind the din -
ing- room clock,’ she said. All those seven years I’ve wound 
that clock every week, and if I forgot it she would always 
remind me. The next day I set off on my way here. I got out 
at the station at daybreak; I’d been asleep, tired out, with 
my eyes half open, I was drinking some coffee. I looked up 
and there was suddenly Marfa Petrovna sitting beside me 
with a pack of cards in her hands. ‘Shall I tell your fortune 
for the journey, Arkady Ivanovitch?’ She was a great hand 
at telling fortunes. I shall never forgive myself for not ask -
ing her to. I ran away in a fright, and, besides, the bell rang.
0 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comI was sitting to-day, feeling very heavy after a miserable 
dinner from a cookshop; I was sitting smoking, all of a sud -
den Marfa Petrovna again. She came in very smart in a new 
green silk dress with a long train. ‘Good day, Arkady Iva -
novitch! How do you like my dress? Aniska can’t make like 
this.’ (Aniska was a dressmaker in the country, one of our 
former serf girls who had been trained in Moscow, a pretty 
wench.) She stood turning round before me. I looked at the 
dress, and then I looked carefully, very carefully, at her face. 
‘I wonder you trouble to come to me about such trifles, Mar -
fa Petrovna.’ ‘Good gracious, you won’t let one disturb you 
about anything!’ To tease her I said, ‘I want to get married, 
Marfa Petrovna.’ ‘That’s just like you, Arkady Ivanovitch; it 
does you very little credit to come looking for a bride when 
you’ve hardly buried your wife. And if you could make a 
good choice, at least, but I know it won’t be for your happi -
ness or hers, you will only be a laughing-stock to all good 
people.’ Then she went out and her train seemed to rustle. 
Isn’t it nonsense, eh?’
‘But perhaps you are telling lies?’ Raskolnikov put in.
‘I rarely lie,’ answered Svidrigaïlov thoughtfully, appar -
ently not noticing the rudeness of the question.
‘And in the past, have you ever seen ghosts before?’
‘Y-yes, I have seen them, but only once in my life, six 
years ago. I had a serf, Filka; just after his burial I called 
out forgetting ‘Filka, my pipe!’ He came in and went to the 
cupboard where my pipes were. I sat still and thought ‘he 
is doing it out of revenge,’ because we had a violent quarrel 
just before his death. ‘How dare you come in with a hole in
Crime and Punishment 0your elbow?’ I said. ‘Go away, you scamp!’ He turned and 
went out, and never came again. I didn’t tell Marfa Petro -
vna at the time. I wanted to have a service sung for him, but 
I was ashamed.’
‘You should go to a doctor.’
‘I know I am not well, without your telling me, though I 
don’t know what’s wrong; I believe I am five times as strong 
as you are. I didn’t ask you whether you believe that ghosts 
are seen, but whether you believe that they exist.’
‘No, I won’t believe it!’ Raskolnikov cried, with positive 
anger.
‘What do people generally say?’ muttered Svidrigaïlov, as 
though speaking to himself, looking aside and bowing his 
head. ‘They say, ‘You are ill, so what appears to you is only 
unreal fantasy.’ But that’s not strictly logical. I agree that 
ghosts only appear to the sick, but that only proves that they 
are unable to appear except to the sick, not that they don’t 
exist.’
‘Nothing of the sort,’ Raskolnikov insisted irritably.
‘No? You don’t think so?’ Svidrigaïlov went on, looking 
at him deliberately. ‘But what do you say to this argument 
(help me with it): ghosts are, as it were, shreds and frag -
ments of other worlds, the beginning of them. A man in 
health has, of course, no reason to see them, because he is 
above all a man of this earth and is bound for the sake of 
completeness and order to live only in this life. But as soon 
as one is ill, as soon as the normal earthly order of the or -
ganism is broken, one begins to realise the possibility of 
another world; and the more seriously ill one is, the closer
0 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.combecomes one’s contact with that other world, so that as soon 
as the man dies he steps straight into that world. I thought 
of that long ago. If you believe in a future life, you could be -
lieve in that, too.’
‘I don’t believe in a future life,’ said Raskolnikov.
Svidrigaïlov sat lost in thought.
‘And what if there are only spiders there, or something of 
that sort,’ he said suddenly.
‘He is a madman,’ thought Raskolnikov.
‘We always imagine eternity as something beyond our 
conception, something vast, vast! But why must it be vast? 
Instead of all that, what if it’s one little room, like a bath 
house in the country, black and grimy and spiders in every 
corner, and that’s all eternity is? I sometimes fancy it like 
that.’
‘Can it be you can imagine nothing juster and more 
comforting than that?’ Raskolnikov cried, with a feeling of 
anguish.
‘Juster? And how can we tell, perhaps that is just, and 
do you know it’s what I would certainly have made it,’ an -
swered Svidrigaïlov, with a vague smile.
This horrible answer sent a cold chill through Raskol -
nikov. Svidrigaïlov raised his head, looked at him, and 
suddenly began laughing.
‘Only think,’ he cried, ‘half an hour ago we had never 
seen each other, we regarded each other as enemies; there 
is a matter unsettled between us; we’ve thrown it aside, and 
away we’ve gone into the abstract! Wasn’t I right in saying 
that we were birds of a feather?’
Crime and Punishment 10‘Kindly allow me,’ Raskolnikov went on irritably, ‘to ask 
you to explain why you have honoured me with your visit … 
and … and I am in a hurry, I have no time to waste. I want 
to go out.’
‘By all means, by all means. Your sister, Avdotya Ro -
manovna, is going to be married to Mr. Luzhin, Pyotr 
Petrovitch?’
‘Can you refrain from any question about my sister and 
from mentioning her name? I can’t understand how you 
dare utter her name in my presence, if you really are Svid -
rigaïlov.’
‘Why, but I’ve come here to speak about her; how can I 
avoid mentioning her?’
‘Very good, speak, but make haste.’
‘I am sure that you must have formed your own opinion 
of this Mr. Luzhin, who is a connection of mine through my 
wife, if you have only seen him for half an hour, or heard any 
facts about him. He is no match for Avdotya Romanovna. 
I believe Avdotya Romanovna is sacrificing herself gener -
ously and imprudently for the sake of … for the sake of her 
family. I fancied from all I had heard of you that you would 
be very glad if the match could be broken off without the 
sacrifice of worldly advantages. Now I know you personally, 
I am convinced of it.’
‘All this is very naïve … excuse me, I should have said im -
pudent on your part,’ said Raskolnikov.
‘You mean to say that I am seeking my own ends. Don’t 
be uneasy, Rodion Romanovitch, if I were working for my 
own advantage, I would not have spoken out so directly. I
11 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comam not quite a fool. I will confess something psychologically 
curious about that: just now, defending my love for Avdotya 
Romanovna, I said I was myself the victim. Well, let me tell 
you that I’ve no feeling of love now, not the slightest, so that 
I wonder myself indeed, for I really did feel something …’
‘Through idleness and depravity,’ Raskolnikov put in.
‘I certainly am idle and depraved, but your sister has 
such qualities that even I could not help being impressed by 
them. But that’s all nonsense, as I see myself now.’
‘Have you seen that long?’
‘I began to be aware of it before, but was only perfectly 
sure of it the day before yesterday, almost at the moment 
I arrived in Petersburg. I still fancied in Moscow, though, 
that I was coming to try to get Avdotya Romanovna’s hand 
and to cut out Mr. Luzhin.’
‘Excuse me for interrupting you; kindly be brief, and 
come to the object of your visit. I am in a hurry, I want to 
go out …’
‘With the greatest pleasure. On arriving here and de -
termining on a certain … journey, I should like to make 
some necessary preliminary arrangements. I left my chil -
dren with an aunt; they are well provided for; and they have 
no need of me personally. And a nice father I should make, 
too! I have taken nothing but what Marfa Petrovna gave me 
a year ago. That’s enough for me. Excuse me, I am just com -
ing to the point. Before the journey which may come off, 
I want to settle Mr. Luzhin, too. It’s not that I detest him 
so much, but it was through him I quarrelled with Marfa 
Petrovna when I learned that she had dished up this mar -
Crime and Punishment 1riage. I want now to see Avdotya Romanovna through your 
mediation, and if you like in your presence, to explain to 
her that in the first place she will never gain anything but 
harm from Mr. Luzhin. Then, begging her pardon for all 
past unpleasantness, to make her a present of ten thousand 
roubles and so assist the rupture with Mr. Luzhin, a rupture 
to which I believe she is herself not disinclined, if she could 
see the way to it.’
‘You are certainly mad,’ cried Raskolnikov not so much 
angered as astonished. ‘How dare you talk like that!’
‘I knew you would scream at me; but in the first place, 
though I am not rich, this ten thousand roubles is perfectly 
free; I have absolutely no need for it. If Avdotya Romanovna 
does not accept it, I shall waste it in some more foolish way. 
That’s the first thing. Secondly, my conscience is perfect -
ly easy; I make the offer with no ulterior motive. You may 
not believe it, but in the end Avdotya Romanovna and you 
will know. The point is, that I did actually cause your sister, 
whom I greatly respect, some trouble and unpleasantness, 
and so, sincerely regretting it, I want—not to compensate, 
not to repay her for the unpleasantness, but simply to do 
something to her advantage, to show that I am not, after all, 
privileged to do nothing but harm. If there were a millionth 
fraction of self-interest in my offer, I should not have made 
it so openly; and I should not have offered her ten thou -
sand only, when five weeks ago I offered her more, Besides, I 
may, perhaps, very soon marry a young lady, and that alone 
ought to prevent suspicion of any design on Avdotya Ro -
manovna. In conclusion, let me say that in marrying Mr.
1 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comLuzhin, she is taking money just the same, only from an -
other man. Don’t be angry, Rodion Romanovitch, think it 
over coolly and quietly.’
Svidrigaïlov himself was exceedingly cool and quiet as 
he was saying this.
‘I beg you to say no more,’ said Raskolnikov. ‘In any case 
this is unpardonable impertinence.’
‘Not in the least. Then a man may do nothing but harm 
to his neighbour in this world, and is prevented from do -
ing the tiniest bit of good by trivial conventional formalities. 
That’s absurd. If I died, for instance, and left that sum to 
your sister in my will, surely she wouldn’t refuse it?’
‘Very likely she would.’
‘Oh, no, indeed. However, if you refuse it, so be it, though 
ten thousand roubles is a capital thing to have on occasion. 
In any case I beg you to repeat what I have said to Avdotya 
Romanovna.’
‘No, I won’t.’
‘In that case, Rodion Romanovitch, I shall be obliged to 
try and see her myself and worry her by doing so.’
‘And if I do tell her, will you not try to see her?’
‘I don’t know really what to say. I should like very much 
to see her once more.’
‘Don’t hope for it.’
‘I’m sorry. But you don’t know me. Perhaps we may be -
come better friends.’
‘You think we may become friends?’
‘And why not?’ Svidrigaïlov said, smiling. He stood up 
and took his hat. ‘I didn’t quite intend to disturb you and
Crime and Punishment 1I came here without reckoning on it … though I was very 
much struck by your face this morning.’
‘Where did you see me this morning?’ Raskolnikov asked 
uneasily.
‘I saw you by chance…. I kept fancying there is some -
thing about you like me…. But don’t be uneasy. I am not 
intrusive; I used to get on all right with card-sharpers, and 
I never bored Prince Svirbey, a great personage who is a 
distant relation of mine, and I could write about Rapha -
el’s Madonna  in Madam Prilukov’s album, and I never left  
Marfa Petrovna’s side for seven years, and I used to stay the 
night at Viazemsky’s house in the Hay Market in the old 
days, and I may go up in a balloon with Berg, perhaps.’
‘Oh, all right. Are you starting soon on your travels, may 
I ask?’
‘What travels?’
‘Why, on that ‘journey’; you spoke of it yourself.’
‘A journey? Oh, yes. I did speak of a journey. Well, that’s 
a wide subject…. if only you knew what you are asking,’ he 
added, and gave a sudden, loud, short laugh. ‘Perhaps I’ll 
get married instead of the journey. They’re making a match 
for me.’
‘Here?’
‘Yes.’
‘How have you had time for that?’
‘But I am very anxious to see Avdotya Romanovna once. 
I earnestly beg it. Well, good-bye for the present. Oh, yes. I

‘Are you telling the truth?’
‘Yes, tell her. Well, your servant. I am staying very near 
you.’
As he went out, Svidrigaïlov ran up against Razumihin 
in the doorway.
Crime and Punishment 1

## Chapter 2

It was nearly eight o’clock. The two young men hurried to 
Bakaleyev’s, to arrive before Luzhin.
‘Why, who was that?’ asked Razumihin, as soon as they 
were in the street.
‘It was Svidrigaïlov, that landowner in whose house my 
sister was insulted when she was their governess. Through 
his persecuting her with his attentions, she was turned out 
by his wife, Marfa Petrovna. This Marfa Petrovna begged 
Dounia’s forgiveness afterwards, and she’s just died sud -
denly. It was of her we were talking this morning. I don’t 
know why I’m afraid of that man. He came here at once af -
ter his wife’s funeral. He is very strange, and is determined 
on doing something…. We must guard Dounia from him … 
that’s what I wanted to tell you, do you hear?’
‘Guard her! What can he do to harm Avdotya Romanov -
na? Thank you, Rodya, for speaking to me like that…. We 
will, we will guard her. Where does he live?’
‘I don’t know.’
‘Why didn’t you ask? What a pity! I’ll find out, though.’
‘Did you see him?’ asked Raskolnikov after a pause.
‘Yes, I noticed him, I noticed him well.’
‘You did really see him? You saw him clearly?’ Raskol -
nikov insisted.
‘Yes, I remember him perfectly, I should know him in a
1 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comthousand; I have a good memory for faces.’
They were silent again.
‘Hm! … that’s all right,’ muttered Raskolnikov. ‘Do you 
know, I fancied … I keep thinking that it may have been an 
hallucination.’
‘What do you mean? I don’t understand you.’
‘Well, you all say,’ Raskolnikov went on, twisting his 
mouth into a smile, ‘that I am mad. I thought just now that 
perhaps I really am mad, and have only seen a phantom.’
‘What do you mean?’
‘Why, who can tell? Perhaps I am really mad, and per -
haps everything that happened all these days may be only 
imagination.’
‘Ach, Rodya, you have been upset again! … But what did 
he say, what did he come for?’
Raskolnikov did not answer. Razumihin thought a min -
ute.
‘Now let me tell you my story,’ he began, ‘I came to you, 
you were asleep. Then we had dinner and then I went to 
Porfiry’s, Zametov was still with him. I tried to begin, but 
it was no use. I couldn’t speak in the right way. They don’t 
seem to understand and can’t understand, but are not a bit 
ashamed. I drew Porfiry to the window, and began talking 
to him, but it was still no use. He looked away and I looked 
away. At last I shook my fist in his ugly face, and told him 
as a cousin I’d brain him. He merely looked at me, I cursed 
and came away. That was all. It was very stupid. To Zametov 
I didn’t say a word. But, you see, I thought I’d made a mess 
of it, but as I went downstairs a brilliant idea struck me: why
Crime and Punishment 1should we trouble? Of course if you were in any danger or 
anything, but why need you care? You needn’t care a hang 
for them. We shall have a laugh at them afterwards, and if 
I were in your place I’d mystify them more than ever. How 
ashamed they’ll be afterwards! Hang them! We can thrash 
them afterwards, but let’s laugh at them now!’
‘To be sure,’ answered Raskolnikov. ‘But what will you 
say to-morrow?’ he thought to himself. Strange to say, till 
that moment it had never occurred to him to wonder what 
Razumihin would think when he knew. As he thought it, 
Raskolnikov looked at him. Razumihin’s account of his vis -
it to Porfiry had very little interest for him, so much had 
come and gone since then.
In the corridor they came upon Luzhin; he had arrived 
punctually at eight, and was looking for the number, so 
that all three went in together without greeting or look -
ing at one another. The young men walked in first, while 
Pyotr Petrovitch, for good manners, lingered a little in the 
passage, taking off his coat. Pulcheria Alexandrovna came 
forward at once to greet him in the doorway, Dounia was 
welcoming her brother. Pyotr Petrovitch walked in and 
quite amiably, though with redoubled dignity, bowed to the 
ladies. He looked, however, as though he were a little put 
out and could not yet recover himself. Pulcheria Alexan -
drovna, who seemed also a little embarrassed, hastened to 
make them all sit down at the round table where a samovar 
was boiling. Dounia and Luzhin were facing one another 
on opposite sides of the table. Razumihin and Raskolnikov 
were facing Pulcheria Alexandrovna, Razumihin was next
1 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comto Luzhin and Raskolnikov was beside his sister.
A moment’s silence followed. Pyotr Petrovitch delib -
erately drew out a cambric handkerchief reeking of scent 
and blew his nose with an air of a benevolent man who felt 
himself slighted, and was firmly resolved to insist on an ex -
planation. In the passage the idea had occurred to him to 
keep on his overcoat and walk away, and so give the two 
ladies a sharp and emphatic lesson and make them feel the 
gravity of the position. But he could not bring himself to 
do this. Besides, he could not endure uncertainty, and he 
wanted an explanation: if his request had been so openly 
disobeyed, there was something behind it, and in that case 
it was better to find it out beforehand; it rested with him to 
punish them and there would always be time for that.
‘I trust you had a favourable journey,’ he inquired offi -
cially of Pulcheria Alexandrovna.
‘Oh, very, Pyotr Petrovitch.’
‘I am gratified to hear it. And Avdotya Romanovna is not 
over-fatigued either?’
‘I am young and strong, I don’t get tired, but it was a great 
strain for mother,’ answered Dounia.
‘That’s unavoidable! our national railways are of terrible 
length. ‘Mother Russia,’ as they say, is a vast country…. In 
spite of all my desire to do so, I was unable to meet you yes -
terday. But I trust all passed off without inconvenience?’
‘Oh, no, Pyotr Petrovitch, it was all terribly disheart -
ening,’ Pulcheria Alexandrovna hastened to declare with 
peculiar intonation, ‘and if Dmitri Prokofitch had not been 
sent us, I really believe by God Himself, we should have
Crime and Punishment 0been utterly lost. Here, he is! Dmitri Prokofitch Razumihin,’ 
she added, introducing him to Luzhin.
‘I had the pleasure … yesterday,’ muttered Pyotr Petro -
vitch with a hostile glance sidelong at Razumihin; then he 
scowled and was silent.
Pyotr Petrovitch belonged to that class of persons, on 
the surface very polite in society, who make a great point of 
punctiliousness, but who, directly they are crossed in any -
thing, are completely disconcerted, and become more like 
sacks of flour than elegant and lively men of society. Again 
all was silent; Raskolnikov was obstinately mute, Avdotya 
Romanovna was unwilling to open the conversation too 
soon. Razumihin had nothing to say, so Pulcheria Alexan -
drovna was anxious again.
‘Marfa Petrovna is dead, have you heard?’ she began hav -
ing recourse to her leading item of conversation.
‘To be sure, I heard so. I was immediately informed, 
and I have come to make you acquainted with the fact that 
Arkady Ivanovitch Svidrigaïlov set off in haste for Peters -
burg immediately after his wife’s funeral. So at least I have 
excellent authority for believing.’
‘To Petersburg? here?’ Dounia asked in alarm and looked 
at her mother.
‘Yes, indeed, and doubtless not without some design, 
having in view the rapidity of his departure, and all the cir -
cumstances preceding it.’
‘Good heavens! won’t he leave Dounia in peace even 
here?’ cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna.
‘I imagine that neither you nor Avdotya Romanovna Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comhave any grounds for uneasiness, unless, of course, you are 
yourselves desirous of getting into communication with 
him. For my part I am on my guard, and am now discover -
ing where he is lodging.’
‘Oh, Pyotr Petrovitch, you would not believe what a fright 
you have given me,’ Pulcheria Alexandrovna went on: ‘I’ve 
only seen him twice, but I thought him terrible, terrible! 
I am convinced that he was the cause of Marfa Petrovna’s 
death.’
‘It’s impossible to be certain about that. I have precise 
information. I do not dispute that he may have contribut -
ed to accelerate the course of events by the moral influence, 
so to say, of the affront; but as to the general conduct and 
moral characteristics of that personage, I am in agreement 
with you. I do not know whether he is well off now, and pre -
cisely what Marfa Petrovna left him; this will be known to 
me within a very short period; but no doubt here in Peters -
burg, if he has any pecuniary resources, he will relapse at 
once into his old ways. He is the most depraved, and abject -
ly vicious specimen of that class of men. I have considerable 
reason to believe that Marfa Petrovna, who was so unfor -
tunate as to fall in love with him and to pay his debts eight 
years ago, was of service to him also in another way. Solely 
by her exertions and sacrifices, a criminal charge, involving 
an element of fantastic and homicidal brutality for which 
he might well have been sentenced to Siberia, was hushed 
up. That’s the sort of man he is, if you care to know.’
‘Good heavens!’ cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna. Raskol -
nikov listened attentively.
Crime and Punishment ‘Are you speaking the truth when you say that you have 
good evidence of this?’ Dounia asked sternly and emphati -
cally.
‘I only repeat what I was told in secret by Marfa Petrovna. 
I must observe that from the legal point of view the case was 
far from clear. There was, and I believe still is, living here 
a woman called Resslich, a foreigner, who lent small sums 
of money at interest, and did other commissions, and with 
this woman Svidrigaïlov had for a long while close and mys -
terious relations. She had a relation, a niece I believe, living 
with her, a deaf and dumb girl of fifteen, or perhaps not 
more than fourteen. Resslich hated this girl, and grudged 
her every crust; she used to beat her mercilessly. One day 
the girl was found hanging in the garret. At the inquest the 
verdict was suicide. After the usual proceedings the matter 
ended, but, later on, information was given that the child 
had been … cruelly outraged by Svidrigaïlov. It is true, this 
was not clearly established, the information was given by 
another German woman of loose character whose word 
could not be trusted; no statement was actually made to the 
police, thanks to Marfa Petrovna’s money and exertions; it 
did not get beyond gossip. And yet the story is a very signifi -
cant one. You heard, no doubt, Avdotya Romanovna, when 
you were with them the story of the servant Philip who died 
of ill treatment he received six years ago, before the aboli -
tion of serfdom.’
‘I heard, on the contrary, that this Philip hanged him -
self.’
‘Quite so, but what drove him, or rather perhaps dis - Free eBooks at Planet eBook.composed him, to suicide was the systematic persecution and 
severity of Mr. Svidrigaïlov.’
‘I don’t know that,’ answered Dounia, dryly. ‘I only heard 
a queer story that Philip was a sort of hypochondriac, a sort 
of domestic philosopher, the servants used to say, ‘he read 
himself silly,’ and that he hanged himself partly on account 
of Mr. Svidrigaïlov’s mockery of him and not his blows. 
When I was there he behaved well to the servants, and they 
were actually fond of him, though they certainly did blame 
him for Philip’s death.’
‘I perceive, Avdotya Romanovna, that you seem disposed 
to undertake his defence all of a sudden,’ Luzhin observed, 
twisting his lips into an ambiguous smile, ‘there’s no doubt 
that he is an astute man, and insinuating where ladies are 
concerned, of which Marfa Petrovna, who has died so 
strangely, is a terrible instance. My only desire has been to 
be of service to you and your mother with my advice, in 
view of the renewed efforts which may certainly be antici -
pated from him. For my part it’s my firm conviction, that he 
will end in a debtor’s prison again. Marfa Petrovna had not 
the slightest intention of settling anything substantial on 
him, having regard for his children’s interests, and, if she 
left him anything, it would only be the merest sufficiency, 
something insignificant and ephemeral, which would not 
last a year for a man of his habits.’
‘Pyotr Petrovitch, I beg you,’ said Dounia, ‘say no more of 
Mr. Svidrigaïlov. It makes me miserable.’
‘He has just been to see me,’ said Raskolnikov, breaking 
his silence for the first time.
Crime and Punishment There were exclamations from all, and they all turned to 
him. Even Pyotr Petrovitch was roused.
‘An hour and a half ago, he came in when I was asleep, 
waked me, and introduced himself,’ Raskolnikov continued. 
‘He was fairly cheerful and at ease, and quite hopes that we 
shall become friends. He is particularly anxious, by the way, 
Dounia, for an interview with you, at which he asked me to 
assist. He has a proposition to make to you, and he told me 
about it. He told me, too, that a week before her death Marfa 
Petrovna left you three thousand roubles in her will, Dou -
nia, and that you can receive the money very shortly.’
‘Thank God!’ cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna, crossing 
herself. ‘Pray for her soul, Dounia!’
‘It’s a fact!’ broke from Luzhin.
‘Tell us, what more?’ Dounia urged Raskolnikov.
‘Then he said that he wasn’t rich and all the estate was 
left to his children who are now with an aunt, then that he 
was staying somewhere not far from me, but where, I don’t 
know, I didn’t ask….’
‘But what, what does he want to propose to Dounia?’ 
cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna in a fright. ‘Did he tell you?’
‘Yes.’
‘What was it?’
‘I’ll tell you afterwards.’
Raskolnikov ceased speaking and turned his attention 
to his tea.
Pyotr Petrovitch looked at his watch.
‘I am compelled to keep a business engagement, and so I 
shall not be in your way,’ he added with an air of some pique Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comand he began getting up.
‘Don’t go, Pyotr Petrovitch,’ said Dounia, ‘you intended 
to spend the evening. Besides, you wrote yourself that you 
wanted to have an explanation with mother.’
‘Precisely so, Avdotya Romanovna,’ Pyotr Petrovitch an -
swered impressively, sitting down again, but still holding 
his hat. ‘I certainly desired an explanation with you and 
your honoured mother upon a very important point indeed. 
But as your brother cannot speak openly in my presence of 
some proposals of Mr. Svidrigaïlov, I, too, do not desire and 
am not able to speak openly … in the presence of others 
… of certain matters of the greatest gravity. Moreover, my 
most weighty and urgent request has been disregarded….’
Assuming an aggrieved air, Luzhin relapsed into digni -
fied silence.
‘Your request that my brother should not be present at our 
meeting was disregarded solely at my instance,’ said Dou -
nia. ‘You wrote that you had been insulted by my brother; I 
think that this must be explained at once, and you must be 
reconciled. And if Rodya really has insulted you, then he 
should  and will apologise.’
Pyotr Petrovitch took a stronger line.
‘There are insults, Avdotya Romanovna, which no good -
will can make us forget. There is a line in everything which 
it is dangerous to overstep; and when it has been over -
stepped, there is no return.’
‘That wasn’t what I was speaking of exactly, Pyotr Petro -
vitch,’ Dounia interrupted with some impatience. ‘Please 
understand that our whole future depends now on wheth -
Crime and Punishment er all this is explained and set right as soon as possible. I 
tell you frankly at the start that I cannot look at it in any 
other light, and if you have the least regard for me, all this 
business must be ended to-day, however hard that may be. 
I repeat that if my brother is to blame he will ask your for -
giveness.’
‘I am surprised at your putting the question like that,’ 
said Luzhin, getting more and more irritated. ‘Esteeming, 
and so to say, adoring you, I may at the same time, very 
well indeed, be able to dislike some member of your family. 
Though I lay claim to the happiness of your hand, I cannot 
accept duties incompatible with …’
‘Ah, don’t be so ready to take offence, Pyotr Petrovitch,’ 
Dounia interrupted with feeling, ‘and be the sensible and 
generous man I have always considered, and wish to con -
sider, you to be. I’ve given you a great promise, I am your 
betrothed. Trust me in this matter and, believe me, I shall 
be capable of judging impartially. My assuming the part of 
judge is as much a surprise for my brother as for you. When 
I insisted on his coming to our interview to-day after your 
letter, I told him nothing of what I meant to do. Understand 
that, if you are not reconciled, I must choose between you—
it must be either you or he. That is how the question rests 
on your side and on his. I don’t want to be mistaken in my 
choice, and I must not be. For your sake I must break off  
with my brother, for my brother’s sake I must break off with 
you. I can find out for certain now whether he is a brother 
to me, and I want to know it; and of you, whether I am dear 
to you, whether you esteem me, whether you are the hus - Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comband for me.’
‘Avdotya Romanovna,’ Luzhin declared huffily, ‘your 
words are of too much consequence to me; I will say more, 
they are offensive in view of the position I have the hon -
our to occupy in relation to you. To say nothing of your 
strange and offensive setting me on a level with an im -
pertinent boy, you admit the possibility of breaking your 
promise to me. You say ‘you or he,’ showing thereby of how 
little consequence I am in your eyes … I cannot let this pass 
considering the relationship and … the obligations existing 
between us.’
‘What!’ cried Dounia, flushing. ‘I set your interest beside 
all that has hitherto been most precious in my life, what has 
made up the whole  of my life, and here you are offended at 
my making too little  account of you.’
Raskolnikov smiled sarcastically, Razumihin fidgeted, 
but Pyotr Petrovitch did not accept the reproof; on the con -
trary, at every word he became more persistent and irritable, 
as though he relished it.
‘Love for the future partner of your life, for your hus -
band, ought to outweigh your love for your brother,’ he 
pronounced sententiously, ‘and in any case I cannot be put 
on the same level…. Although I said so emphatically that 
I would not speak openly in your brother’s presence, nev -
ertheless, I intend now to ask your honoured mother for a 
necessary explanation on a point of great importance close -
ly affecting my dignity. Your son,’ he turned to Pulcheria 
Alexandrovna, ‘yesterday in the presence of Mr. Razsud -
kin (or … I think that’s it? excuse me I have forgotten your
Crime and Punishment surname,’ he bowed politely to Razumihin) ‘insulted me 
by misrepresenting the idea I expressed to you in a private 
conversation, drinking coffee, that is, that marriage with a 
poor girl who has had experience of trouble is more advan -
tageous from the conjugal point of view than with one who 
has lived in luxury, since it is more profitable for the moral 
character. Your son intentionally exaggerated the signifi -
cance of my words and made them ridiculous, accusing 
me of malicious intentions, and, as far as I could see, relied 
upon your correspondence with him. I shall consider my -
self happy, Pulcheria Alexandrovna, if it is possible for you 
to convince me of an opposite conclusion, and thereby con -
siderately reassure me. Kindly let me know in what terms 
precisely you repeated my words in your letter to Rodion 
Romanovitch.’
‘I don’t remember,’ faltered Pulcheria Alexandrovna. ‘I 
repeated them as I understood them. I don’t know how Ro -
dya repeated them to you, perhaps he exaggerated.’
‘He could not have exaggerated them, except at your in -
stigation.’
‘Pyotr Petrovitch,’ Pulcheria Alexandrovna declared 
with dignity, ‘the proof that Dounia and I did not take your 
words in a very bad sense is the fact that we are here.’
‘Good, mother,’ said Dounia approvingly.
‘Then this is my fault again,’ said Luzhin, aggrieved.
‘Well, Pyotr Petrovitch, you keep blaming Rodion, but 
you yourself have just written what was false about him,’ 
Pulcheria Alexandrovna added, gaining courage.
‘I don’t remember writing anything false.’ Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com‘You wrote,’ Raskolnikov said sharply, not turning to Lu -
zhin, ‘that I gave money yesterday not to the widow of the 
man who was killed, as was the fact, but to his daughter 
(whom I had never seen till yesterday). You wrote this to 
make dissension between me and my family, and for that 
object added coarse expressions about the conduct of a girl 
whom you don’t know. All that is mean slander.’
‘Excuse me, sir,’ said Luzhin, quivering with fury. ‘I en -
larged upon your qualities and conduct in my letter solely 
in response to your sister’s and mother’s inquiries, how I 
found you, and what impression you made on me. As for 
what you’ve alluded to in my letter, be so good as to point 
out one word of falsehood, show, that is, that you didn’t 
throw away your money, and that there are not worthless 
persons in that family, however unfortunate.’
‘To my thinking, you, with all your virtues, are not worth 
the little finger of that unfortunate girl at whom you throw 
stones.’
‘Would you go so far then as to let her associate with your 
mother and sister?’
‘I have done so already, if you care to know. I made her sit 
down to-day with mother and Dounia.’
‘Rodya!’ cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna. Dounia crim -
soned, Razumihin knitted his brows. Luzhin smiled with 
lofty sarcasm.
‘You may see for yourself, Avdotya Romanovna,’ he said, 
‘whether it is possible for us to agree. I hope now that this 
question is at an end, once and for all. I will withdraw, that 
I may not hinder the pleasures of family intimacy, and the
Crime and Punishment 0discussion of secrets.’ He got up from his chair and took 
his hat. ‘But in withdrawing, I venture to request that for 
the future I may be spared similar meetings, and, so to say, 
compromises. I appeal particularly to you, honoured Pul -
cheria Alexandrovna, on this subject, the more as my letter 
was addressed to you and to no one else.’
Pulcheria Alexandrovna was a little offended.
‘You seem to think we are completely under your author -
ity, Pyotr Petrovitch. Dounia has told you the reason your 
desire was disregarded, she had the best intentions. And in -
deed you write as though you were laying commands upon 
me. Are we to consider every desire of yours as a command? 
Let me tell you on the contrary that you ought to show par -
ticular delicacy and consideration for us now, because we 
have thrown up everything, and have come here relying on 
you, and so we are in any case in a sense in your hands.’
‘That is not quite true, Pulcheria Alexandrovna, espe -
cially at the present moment, when the news has come of 
Marfa Petrovna’s legacy, which seems indeed very apropos, 
judging from the new tone you take to me,’ he added sar -
castically.
‘Judging from that remark, we may certainly presume 
that you were reckoning on our helplessness,’ Dounia ob -
served irritably.
‘But now in any case I cannot reckon on it, and I par -
ticularly desire not to hinder your discussion of the secret 
proposals of Arkady Ivanovitch Svidrigaïlov, which he has 
entrusted to your brother and which have, I perceive, a great 
and possibly a very agreeable interest for you.’ Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com‘Good heavens!’ cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna.
Razumihin could not sit still on his chair.
‘Aren’t you ashamed now, sister?’ asked Raskolnikov.
‘I am ashamed, Rodya,’ said Dounia. ‘Pyotr Petrovitch, 
go away,’ she turned to him, white with anger.
Pyotr Petrovitch had apparently not at all expected such 
a conclusion. He had too much confidence in himself, in his 
power and in the helplessness of his victims. He could not 
believe it even now. He turned pale, and his lips quivered.
‘Avdotya Romanovna, if I go out of this door now, after 
such a dismissal, then, you may reckon on it, I will never 
come back. Consider what you are doing. My word is not 
to be shaken.’
‘What insolence!’ cried Dounia, springing up from her 
seat. ‘I don’t want you to come back again.’
‘What! So that’s how it stands!’ cried Luzhin, utterly un -
able to the last moment to believe in the rupture and so 
completely thrown out of his reckoning now. ‘So that’s how 
it stands! But do you know, Avdotya Romanovna, that I 
might protest?’
‘What right have you to speak to her like that?’ Pulcheria 
Alexandrovna intervened hotly. ‘And what can you protest 
about? What rights have you? Am I to give my Dounia to a 
man like you? Go away, leave us altogether! We are to blame 
for having agreed to a wrong action, and I above all….’
‘But you have bound me, Pulcheria Alexandrovna,’ Lu -
zhin stormed in a frenzy, ‘by your promise, and now you 
deny it and … besides … I have been led on account of that 
into expenses….’
Crime and Punishment This last complaint was so characteristic of Pyotr Petro -
vitch, that Raskolnikov, pale with anger and with the effort 
of restraining it, could not help breaking into laughter. But 
Pulcheria Alexandrovna was furious.
‘Expenses? What expenses? Are you speaking of our 
trunk? But the conductor brought it for nothing for you. 
Mercy on us, we have bound you! What are you thinking 
about, Pyotr Petrovitch, it was you bound us, hand and foot, 
not we!’
‘Enough, mother, no more please,’ Avdotya Romanovna 
implored. ‘Pyotr Petrovitch, do be kind and go!’
‘I am going, but one last word,’ he said, quite unable to 
control himself. ‘Your mamma seems to have entirely for -
gotten that I made up my mind to take you, so to speak, 
after the gossip of the town had spread all over the district 
in regard to your reputation. Disregarding public opinion 
for your sake and reinstating your reputation, I certainly 
might very well reckon on a fitting return, and might in -
deed look for gratitude on your part. And my eyes have only 
now been opened! I see myself that I may have acted very, 
very recklessly in disregarding the universal verdict….’
‘Does the fellow want his head smashed?’ cried Razumi -
hin, jumping up.
‘You are a mean and spiteful man!’ cried Dounia.
‘Not a word! Not a movement!’ cried Raskolnikov, hold -
ing Razumihin back; then going close up to Luzhin, ‘Kindly 
leave the room!’ he said quietly and distinctly, ‘and not a 
word more or …’
Pyotr Petrovitch gazed at him for some seconds with a Free eBooks at Planet eBook.compale face that worked with anger, then he turned, went out, 
and rarely has any man carried away in his heart such vin -
dictive hatred as he felt against Raskolnikov. Him, and him 
alone, he blamed for everything. It is noteworthy that as he 
went downstairs he still imagined that his case was perhaps 
not utterly lost, and that, so far as the ladies were concerned, 
all might ‘very well indeed’ be set right again.
Crime and Punishment 

## Chapter 3

The fact was that up to the last moment he had never ex -
pected such an ending; he had been overbearing to the 
last degree, never dreaming that two destitute and defence -
less women could escape from his control. This conviction 
was strengthened by his vanity and conceit, a conceit to the 
point of fatuity. Pyotr Petrovitch, who had made his way up 
from insignificance, was morbidly given to self-admiration, 
had the highest opinion of his intelligence and capacities, 
and sometimes even gloated in solitude over his image in 
the glass. But what he loved and valued above all was the 
money he had amassed by his labour, and by all sorts of de -
vices: that money made him the equal of all who had been 
his superiors.
When he had bitterly reminded Dounia that he had de -
cided to take her in spite of evil report, Pyotr Petrovitch had 
spoken with perfect sincerity and had, indeed, felt genuine -
ly indignant at such ‘black ingratitude.’ And yet, when he 
made Dounia his offer, he was fully aware of the ground -
lessness of all the gossip. The story had been everywhere 
contradicted by Marfa Petrovna, and was by then disbe -
lieved by all the townspeople, who were warm in Dounia’a 
defence. And he would not have denied that he knew all that 
at the time. Yet he still thought highly of his own resolution 
in lifting Dounia to his level and regarded it as something Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comheroic. In speaking of it to Dounia, he had let out the secret 
feeling he cherished and admired, and he could not under -
stand that others should fail to admire it too. He had called 
on Raskolnikov with the feelings of a benefactor who is 
about to reap the fruits of his good deeds and to hear agree -
able flattery. And as he went downstairs now, he considered 
himself most undeservedly injured and unrecognised.
Dounia was simply essential to him; to do without her 
was unthinkable. For many years he had had voluptuous 
dreams of marriage, but he had gone on waiting and amass -
ing money. He brooded with relish, in profound secret, over 
the image of a girl—virtuous, poor (she must be poor), very 
young, very pretty, of good birth and education, very timid, 
one who had suffered much, and was completely humbled 
before him, one who would all her life look on him as her 
saviour, worship him, admire him and only him. How 
many scenes, how many amorous episodes he had imag -
ined on this seductive and playful theme, when his work 
was over! And, behold, the dream of so many years was 
all but realised; the beauty and education of Avdotya Ro -
manovna had impressed him; her helpless position had been 
a great allurement; in her he had found even more than he 
dreamed of. Here was a girl of pride, character, virtue, of 
education and breeding superior to his own (he felt that), 
and this creature would be slavishly grateful all her life for 
his heroic condescension, and would humble herself in the 
dust before him, and he would have absolute, unbounded 
power over her! … Not long before, he had, too, after long 
reflection and hesitation, made an important change in his
Crime and Punishment career and was now entering on a wider circle of business. 
With this change his cherished dreams of rising into a high -
er class of society seemed likely to be realised…. He was, in 
fact, determined to try his fortune in Petersburg. He knew 
that women could do a very great deal. The fascination of a 
charming, virtuous, highly educated woman might make 
his way easier, might do wonders in attracting people to 
him, throwing an aureole round him, and now everything 
was in ruins! This sudden horrible rupture affected him like 
a clap of thunder; it was like a hideous joke, an absurdity. 
He had only been a tiny bit masterful, had not even time 
to speak out, had simply made a joke, been carried away 
—and it had ended so seriously. And, of course, too, he did 
love Dounia in his own way; he already possessed her in his 
dreams—and all at once! No! The next day, the very next 
day, it must all be set right, smoothed over, settled. Above 
all he must crush that conceited milksop who was the cause 
of it all. With a sick feeling he could not help recalling Ra -
zumihin too, but, he soon reassured himself on that score; 
as though a fellow like that could be put on a level with him! 
The man he really dreaded in earnest was Svidrigaïlov…. He 
had, in short, a great deal to attend to….
*****
‘No, I, I am more to blame than anyone!’ said Dounia, 
kissing and embracing her mother. ‘I was tempted by his 
money, but on my honour, brother, I had no idea he was 
such a base man. If I had seen through him before, nothing 
would have tempted me! Don’t blame me, brother!’
‘God has delivered us! God has delivered us!’ Pulcheria Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comAlexandrovna muttered, but half consciously, as though 
scarcely able to realise what had happened.
They were all relieved, and in five minutes they were 
laughing. Only now and then Dounia turned white and 
frowned, remembering what had passed. Pulcheria Alexan -
drovna was surprised to find that she, too, was glad: she had 
only that morning thought rupture with Luzhin a terrible 
misfortune. Razumihin was delighted. He did not yet dare 
to express his joy fully, but he was in a fever of excitement as 
though a ton-weight had fallen off his heart. Now he had the 
right to devote his life to them, to serve them…. Anything 
might happen now! But he felt afraid to think of further 
possibilities and dared not let his imagination range. But 
Raskolnikov sat still in the same place, almost sullen and 
indifferent. Though he had been the most insistent on get -
ting rid of Luzhin, he seemed now the least concerned at 
what had happened. Dounia could not help thinking that 
he was still angry with her, and Pulcheria Alexandrovna 
watched him timidly.
‘What did Svidrigaïlov say to you?’ said Dounia, ap -
proaching him.
‘Yes, yes!’ cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna.
Raskolnikov raised his head.
‘He wants to make you a present of ten thousand roubles 
and he desires to see you once in my presence.’
‘See her! On no account!’ cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna. 
‘And how dare he offer her money!’
Then Raskolnikov repeated (rather dryly) his conversa -
tion with Svidrigaïlov, omitting his account of the ghostly
Crime and Punishment visitations of Marfa Petrovna, wishing to avoid all unneces -
sary talk.
‘What answer did you give him?’ asked Dounia.
‘At first I said I would not take any message to you. Then 
he said that he would do his utmost to obtain an interview 
with you without my help. He assured me that his passion 
for you was a passing infatuation, now he has no feeling for 
you. He doesn’t want you to marry Luzhin…. His talk was 
altogether rather muddled.’
‘How do you explain him to yourself, Rodya? How did 
he strike you?’
‘I must confess I don’t quite understand him. He offers 
you ten thousand, and yet says he is not well off. He says 
he is going away, and in ten minutes he forgets he has said 
it. Then he says is he going to be married and has already 
fixed on the girl…. No doubt he has a motive, and probably 
a bad one. But it’s odd that he should be so clumsy about it if 
he had any designs against you…. Of course, I refused this 
money on your account, once for all. Altogether, I thought 
him very strange…. One might almost think he was mad. 
But I may be mistaken; that may only be the part he as -
sumes. The death of Marfa Petrovna seems to have made a 
great impression on him.’
‘God rest her soul,’ exclaimed Pulcheria Alexandrovna. 
‘I shall always, always pray for her! Where should we be 
now, Dounia, without this three thousand! It’s as though it 
had fallen from heaven! Why, Rodya, this morning we had 
only three roubles in our pocket and Dounia and I were just 
planning to pawn her watch, so as to avoid borrowing from Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comthat man until he offered help.’
Dounia seemed strangely impressed by Svidrigaïlov’s of -
fer. She still stood meditating.
‘He has got some terrible plan,’ she said in a half whisper 
to herself, almost shuddering.
Raskolnikov noticed this disproportionate terror.
‘I fancy I shall have to see him more than once again,’ he 
said to Dounia.
‘We will watch him! I will track him out!’ cried Razumi -
hin, vigorously. ‘I won’t lose sight of him. Rodya has given 
me leave. He said to me himself just now. ‘Take care of my 
sister.’ Will you give me leave, too, Avdotya Romanovna?’
Dounia smiled and held out her hand, but the look of 
anxiety did not leave her face. Pulcheria Alexandrovna 
gazed at her timidly, but the three thousand roubles had 
obviously a soothing effect on her.
A quarter of an hour later, they were all engaged in a 
lively conversation. Even Raskolnikov listened attentively 
for some time, though he did not talk. Razumihin was the 
speaker.
‘And why, why should you go away?’ he flowed on ecstati -
cally. ‘And what are you to do in a little town? The great 
thing is, you are all here together and you need one an -
other—you do need one another, believe me. For a time, 
anyway…. Take me into partnership, and I assure you we’ll 
plan a capital enterprise. Listen! I’ll explain it all in detail 
to you, the whole project! It all flashed into my head this 
morning, before anything had happened … I tell you what; 
I have an uncle, I must introduce him to you (a most ac -
Crime and Punishment 0commodating and respectable old man). This uncle has got 
a capital of a thousand roubles, and he lives on his pension 
and has no need of that money. For the last two years he has 
been bothering me to borrow it from him and pay him six 
per cent. interest. I know what that means; he simply wants 
to help me. Last year I had no need of it, but this year I re -
solved to borrow it as soon as he arrived. Then you lend me 
another thousand of your three and we have enough for a 
start, so we’ll go into partnership, and what are we going 
to do?’
Then Razumihin began to unfold his project, and he 
explained at length that almost all our publishers and book -
sellers know nothing at all of what they are selling, and for 
that reason they are usually bad publishers, and that any 
decent publications pay as a rule and give a profit, some -
times a considerable one. Razumihin had, indeed, been 
dreaming of setting up as a publisher. For the last two years 
he had been working in publishers’ offices, and knew three 
European languages well, though he had told Raskolnikov 
six days before that he was ‘schwach’ in German with an 
object of persuading him to take half his translation and 
half the payment for it. He had told a lie then, and Raskol -
nikov knew he was lying.
‘Why, why should we let our chance slip when we have 
one of the chief means of success—money of our own!’ cried 
Razumihin warmly. ‘Of course there will be a lot of work, 
but we will work, you, Avdotya Romanovna, I, Rodion…. 
You get a splendid profit on some books nowadays! And the 
great point of the business is that we shall know just what Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comwants translating, and we shall be translating, publishing, 
learning all at once. I can be of use because I have experi -
ence. For nearly two years I’ve been scuttling about among 
the publishers, and now I know every detail of their busi -
ness. You need not be a saint to make pots, believe me! And 
why, why should we let our chance slip! Why, I know—and 
I kept the secret—two or three books which one might get 
a hundred roubles simply for thinking of translating and 
publishing. Indeed, and I would not take five hundred for 
the very idea of one of them. And what do you think? If I 
were to tell a publisher, I dare say he’d hesitate—they are 
such blockheads! And as for the business side, printing, pa -
per, selling, you trust to me, I know my way about. We’ll 
begin in a small way and go on to a large. In any case it will 
get us our living and we shall get back our capital.’
Dounia’s eyes shone.
‘I like what you are saying, Dmitri Prokofitch!’ she said.
‘I know nothing about it, of course,’ put in Pulcheria Al -
exandrovna, ‘it may be a good idea, but again God knows. 
It’s new and untried. Of course, we must remain here at 
least for a time.’ She looked at Rodya.
‘What do you think, brother?’ said Dounia.
‘I think he’s got a very good idea,’ he answered. ‘Of 
course, it’s too soon to dream of a publishing firm, but we 
certainly might bring out five or six books and be sure of 
success. I know of one book myself which would be sure to 
go well. And as for his being able to manage it, there’s no 
doubt about that either. He knows the business…. But we 
can talk it over later….’
Crime and Punishment ‘Hurrah!’ cried Razumihin. ‘Now, stay, there’s a flat here 
in this house, belonging to the same owner. It’s a special 
flat apart, not communicating with these lodgings. It’s fur -
nished, rent moderate, three rooms. Suppose you take them 
to begin with. I’ll pawn your watch to-morrow and bring 
you the money, and everything can be arranged then. You 
can all three live together, and Rodya will be with you. But 
where are you off to, Rodya?’
‘What, Rodya, you are going already?’ Pulcheria Alexan -
drovna asked in dismay.
‘At such a minute?’ cried Razumihin.
Dounia looked at her brother with incredulous won -
der. He held his cap in his hand, he was preparing to leave 
them.
‘One would think you were burying me or saying good-
bye for ever,’ he said somewhat oddly. He attempted to 
smile, but it did not turn out a smile. ‘But who knows, per -
haps it is the last time we shall see each other …’ he let slip 
accidentally. It was what he was thinking, and it somehow 
was uttered aloud.
‘What is the matter with you?’ cried his mother.
‘Where are you going, Rodya?’ asked Dounia rather 
strangely.
‘Oh, I’m quite obliged to …’ he answered vaguely, as 
though hesitating what he would say. But there was a look 
of sharp determination in his white face.
‘I meant to say … as I was coming here … I meant to 
tell you, mother, and you, Dounia, that it would be better 
for us to part for a time. I feel ill, I am not at peace…. I will Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comcome afterwards, I will come of myself … when it’s possible. 
I remember you and love you…. Leave me, leave me alone. 
I decided this even before … I’m absolutely resolved on it. 
Whatever may come to me, whether I come to ruin or not, 
I want to be alone. Forget me altogether, it’s better. Don’t 
inquire about me. When I can, I’ll come of myself or … I’ll 
send for you. Perhaps it will all come back, but now if you 
love me, give me up … else I shall begin to hate you, I feel 
it…. Good-bye!’
‘Good God!’ cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna. Both his 
mother and his sister were terribly alarmed. Razumihin 
was also.
‘Rodya, Rodya, be reconciled with us! Let us be as before!’ 
cried his poor mother.
He turned slowly to the door and slowly went out of the 
room. Dounia overtook him.
‘Brother, what are you doing to mother?’ she whispered, 
her eyes flashing with indignation.
He looked dully at her.
‘No matter, I shall come…. I’m coming,’ he muttered in 
an undertone, as though not fully conscious of what he was 
saying, and he went out of the room.
‘Wicked, heartless egoist!’ cried Dounia.
‘He is insane, but not heartless. He is mad! Don’t you see 
it? You’re heartless after that!’ Razumihin whispered in her 
ear, squeezing her hand tightly. ‘I shall be back directly,’ he 
shouted to the horror- stricken mother, and he ran out of 
the room.
Raskolnikov was waiting for him at the end of the pas -
Crime and Punishment sage.
‘I knew you would run after me,’ he said. ‘Go back to 
them—be with them … be with them to-morrow and al -
ways…. I … perhaps I shall come … if I can. Good-bye.’
And without holding out his hand he walked away.
‘But where are you going? What are you doing? What’s 
the matter with you? How can you go on like this?’ Razu -
mihin muttered, at his wits’ end.
Raskolnikov stopped once more.
‘Once for all, never ask me about anything. I have noth -
ing to tell you. Don’t come to see me. Maybe I’ll come here…. 
Leave me, but don’t leave  them. Do you understand me?’
It was dark in the corridor, they were standing near the 
lamp. For a minute they were looking at one another in 
silence. Razumihin remembered that minute all his life. Ras -
kolnikov’s burning and intent eyes grew more penetrating 
every moment, piercing into his soul, into his conscious -
ness. Suddenly Razumihin started. Something strange, as 
it were, passed between them…. Some idea, some hint, as it 
were, slipped, something awful, hideous, and suddenly un -
derstood on both sides…. Razumihin turned pale.
‘Do you understand now?’ said Raskolnikov, his face 
twitching nervously. ‘Go back, go to them,’ he said suddenly, 
and turning quickly, he went out of the house.
I will not attempt to describe how Razumihin went back 
to the ladies, how he soothed them, how he protested that 
Rodya needed rest in his illness, protested that Rodya was 
sure to come, that he would come every day, that he was 
very, very much upset, that he must not be irritated, that he, Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comRazumihin, would watch over him, would get him a doctor, 
the best doctor, a consultation…. In fact from that evening 
Razumihin took his place with them as a son and a brother.

## Chapter 4

Raskolnikov went straight to the house on the canal bank 
where Sonia lived. It was an old green house of three 
storeys. He found the porter and obtained from him vague 
directions as to the whereabouts of Kapernaumov, the tailor. 
Having found in the corner of the courtyard the entrance 
to the dark and narrow staircase, he mounted to the second 
floor and came out into a gallery that ran round the whole 
second storey over the yard. While he was wandering in the 
darkness, uncertain where to turn for Kapernaumov’s door, 
a door opened three paces from him; he mechanically took 
hold of it.
‘Who is there?’ a woman’s voice asked uneasily.
‘It’s I … come to see you,’ answered Raskolnikov and he 
walked into the tiny entry.
On a broken chair stood a candle in a battered copper 
candlestick.
‘It’s you! Good heavens!’ cried Sonia weakly, and she 
stood rooted to the spot.
‘Which is your room? This way?’ and Raskolnikov, trying 
not to look at her, hastened in.
A minute later Sonia, too, came in with the candle, set 
down the candlestick and, completely disconcerted, stood 
before him inexpressibly agitated and apparently fright -
ened by his unexpected visit. The colour rushed suddenly Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comto her pale face and tears came into her eyes … She felt sick 
and ashamed and happy, too…. Raskolnikov turned away 
quickly and sat on a chair by the table. He scanned the 
room in a rapid glance.
It was a large but exceedingly low-pitched room, the only 
one let by the Kapernaumovs, to whose rooms a closed door 
led in the wall on the left. In the opposite side on the right 
hand wall was another door, always kept locked. That led 
to the next flat, which formed a separate lodging. Sonia’s 
room looked like a barn; it was a very irregular quadrangle 
and this gave it a grotesque appearance. A wall with three 
windows looking out on to the canal ran aslant so that one 
corner formed a very acute angle, and it was difficult to see 
in it without very strong light. The other corner was dis -
proportionately obtuse. There was scarcely any furniture 
in the big room: in the corner on the right was a bedstead, 
beside it, nearest the door, a chair. A plain, deal table cov -
ered by a blue cloth stood against the same wall, close to the 
door into the other flat. Two rush-bottom chairs stood by 
the table. On the opposite wall near the acute angle stood 
a small plain wooden chest of drawers looking, as it were, 
lost in a desert. That was all there was in the room. The 
yellow, scratched and shabby wall- paper was black in the 
corners. It must have been damp and full of fumes in the 
winter. There was every sign of poverty; even the bedstead 
had no curtain.
Sonia looked in silence at her visitor, who was so atten -
tively and unceremoniously scrutinising her room, and 
even began at last to tremble with terror, as though she was
Crime and Punishment standing before her judge and the arbiter of her destinies.
‘I am late…. It’s eleven, isn’t it?’ he asked, still not lifting 
his eyes.
‘Yes,’ muttered Sonia, ‘oh yes, it is,’ she added, hastily, as 
though in that lay her means of escape. ‘My landlady’s clock 
has just struck … I heard it myself….’
‘I’ve come to you for the last time,’ Raskolnikov went on 
gloomily, although this was the first time. ‘I may perhaps 
not see you again …’
‘Are you … going away?’
‘I don’t know … to-morrow….’
‘Then you are not coming to Katerina Ivanovna to-mor -
row?’ Sonia’s voice shook.
‘I don’t know. I shall know to-morrow morning…. Never 
mind that: I’ve come to say one word….’
He raised his brooding eyes to her and suddenly noticed 
that he was sitting down while she was all the while stand -
ing before him.
‘Why are you standing? Sit down,’ he said in a changed 
voice, gentle and friendly.
She sat down. He looked kindly and almost compassion -
ately at her.
‘How thin you are! What a hand! Quite transparent, like 
a dead hand.’
He took her hand. Sonia smiled faintly.
‘I have always been like that,’ she said.
‘Even when you lived at home?’
‘Yes.’
‘Of course, you were,’ he added abruptly and the expres - Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comsion of his face and the sound of his voice changed again 
suddenly.
He looked round him once more.
‘You rent this room from the Kapernaumovs?’
‘Yes….’
‘They live there, through that door?’
‘Yes…. They have another room like this.’
‘All in one room?’
‘Yes.’
‘I should be afraid in your room at night,’ he observed 
gloomily.
‘They are very good people, very kind,’ answered Sonia, 
who still seemed bewildered, ‘and all the furniture, every -
thing … everything is theirs. And they are very kind and 
the children, too, often come to see me.’
‘They all stammer, don’t they?’
‘Yes…. He stammers and he’s lame. And his wife, too…. 
It’s not exactly that she stammers, but she can’t speak plain -
ly. She is a very kind woman. And he used to be a house serf. 
And there are seven children … and it’s only the eldest one 
that stammers and the others are simply ill … but they don’t 
stammer…. But where did you hear about them?’ she added 
with some surprise.
‘Your father told me, then. He told me all about you…. 
And how you went out at six o’clock and came back at nine 
and how Katerina Ivanovna knelt down by your bed.’
Sonia was confused.
‘I fancied I saw him to-day,’ she whispered hesitatingly.
‘Whom?’
Crime and Punishment 0‘Father. I was walking in the street, out there at the cor -
ner, about ten o’clock and he seemed to be walking in front. 
It looked just like him. I wanted to go to Katerina Ivanov -
na….’
‘You were walking in the streets?’
‘Yes,’ Sonia whispered abruptly, again overcome with 
confusion and looking down.
‘Katerina Ivanovna used to beat you, I dare say?’
‘Oh no, what are you saying? No!’ Sonia looked at him 
almost with dismay.
‘You love her, then?’
‘Love her? Of course!’ said Sonia with plaintive empha -
sis, and she clasped her hands in distress. ‘Ah, you don’t…. 
If you only knew! You see, she is quite like a child…. Her 
mind is quite unhinged, you see … from sorrow. And how 
clever she used to be … how generous … how kind! Ah, you 
don’t understand, you don’t understand!’
Sonia said this as though in despair, wringing her hands 
in excitement and distress. Her pale cheeks flushed, there 
was a look of anguish in her eyes. It was clear that she was 
stirred to the very depths, that she was longing to speak, 
to champion, to express something. A sort of insatiable  
compassion, if one may so express it, was reflected in every 
feature of her face.
‘Beat me! how can you? Good heavens, beat me! And if 
she did beat me, what then? What of it? You know nothing, 
nothing about it…. She is so unhappy … ah, how unhap -
py! And ill…. She is seeking righteousness, she is pure. She 
has such faith that there must be righteousness everywhere Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comand she expects it…. And if you were to torture her, she 
wouldn’t do wrong. She doesn’t see that it’s impossible for 
people to be righteous and she is angry at it. Like a child, 
like a child. She is good!’
‘And what will happen to you?’
Sonia looked at him inquiringly.
‘They are left on your hands, you see. They were all on 
your hands before, though…. And your father came to you 
to beg for drink. Well, how will it be now?’
‘I don’t know,’ Sonia articulated mournfully.
‘Will they stay there?’
‘I don’t know…. They are in debt for the lodging, but the 
landlady, I hear, said to-day that she wanted to get rid of 
them, and Katerina Ivanovna says that she won’t stay an -
other minute.’
‘How is it she is so bold? She relies upon you?’
‘Oh, no, don’t talk like that…. We are one, we live like 
one.’ Sonia was agitated again and even angry, as though 
a canary or some other little bird were to be angry. ‘And 
what could she do? What, what could she do?’ she persist -
ed, getting hot and excited. ‘And how she cried to-day! Her 
mind is unhinged, haven’t you noticed it? At one minute 
she is worrying like a child that everything should be right 
to-morrow, the lunch and all that…. Then she is wringing 
her hands, spitting blood, weeping, and all at once she will 
begin knocking her head against the wall, in despair. Then 
she will be comforted again. She builds all her hopes on 
you; she says that you will help her now and that she will 
borrow a little money somewhere and go to her native town
Crime and Punishment with me and set up a boarding school for the daughters of 
gentlemen and take me to superintend it, and we will begin 
a new splendid life. And she kisses and hugs me, comforts 
me, and you know she has such faith, such faith in her fan -
cies! One can’t contradict her. And all the day long she has 
been washing, cleaning, mending. She dragged the wash 
tub into the room with her feeble hands and sank on the 
bed, gasping for breath. We went this morning to the shops 
to buy shoes for Polenka and Lida for theirs are quite worn 
out. Only the money we’d reckoned wasn’t enough, not 
nearly enough. And she picked out such dear little boots, 
for she has taste, you don’t know. And there in the shop 
she burst out crying before the shopmen because she hadn’t 
enough…. Ah, it was sad to see her….’
‘Well, after that I can understand your living like this,’ 
Raskolnikov said with a bitter smile.
‘And aren’t you sorry for them? Aren’t you sorry?’ Sonia 
flew at him again. ‘Why, I know, you gave your last penny 
yourself, though you’d seen nothing of it, and if you’d seen 
everything, oh dear! And how often, how often I’ve brought 
her to tears! Only last week! Yes, I! Only a week before his 
death. I was cruel! And how often I’ve done it! Ah, I’ve been 
wretched at the thought of it all day!’
Sonia wrung her hands as she spoke at the pain of re -
membering it.
‘You were cruel?’
‘Yes, I—I. I went to see them,’ she went on, weeping, ‘and 
father said, ‘read me something, Sonia, my head aches, read 
to me, here’s a book.’ He had a book he had got from Andrey Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comSemyonovitch Lebeziatnikov, he lives there, he always used 
to get hold of such funny books. And I said, ‘I can’t stay,’ as 
I didn’t want to read, and I’d gone in chiefly to show Kat -
erina Ivanovna some collars. Lizaveta, the pedlar, sold me 
some collars and cuffs cheap, pretty, new, embroidered ones. 
Katerina Ivanovna liked them very much; she put them on 
and looked at herself in the glass and was delighted with 
them. ‘Make me a present of them, Sonia,’ she said, ‘please 
do.’ ‘ Please do  ‘ she said, she wanted them so much. And 
when could she wear them? They just reminded her of her 
old happy days. She looked at herself in the glass, admired 
herself, and she has no clothes at all, no things of her own, 
hasn’t had all these years! And she never asks anyone for 
anything; she is proud, she’d sooner give away everything. 
And these she asked for, she liked them so much. And I was 
sorry to give them. ‘What use are they to you, Katerina Iva -
novna?’ I said. I spoke like that to her, I ought not to have 
said that! She gave me such a look. And she was so grieved, 
so grieved at my refusing her. And it was so sad to see…. 
And she was not grieved for the collars, but for my refus -
ing, I saw that. Ah, if only I could bring it all back, change it, 
take back those words! Ah, if I … but it’s nothing to you!’
‘Did you know Lizaveta, the pedlar?’
‘Yes…. Did you know her?’ Sonia asked with some sur -
prise.
‘Katerina Ivanovna is in consumption, rapid consump -
tion; she will soon die,’ said Raskolnikov after a pause, 
without answering her question.
‘Oh, no, no, no!’
Crime and Punishment And Sonia unconsciously clutched both his hands, as 
though imploring that she should not.
‘But it will be better if she does die.’
‘No, not better, not at all better!’ Sonia unconsciously re -
peated in dismay.
‘And the children? What can you do except take them to 
live with you?’
‘Oh, I don’t know,’ cried Sonia, almost in despair, and she 
put her hands to her head.
It was evident that that idea had very often occurred to 
her before and he had only roused it again.
‘And, what, if even now, while Katerina Ivanovna is alive, 
you get ill and are taken to the hospital, what will happen 
then?’ he persisted pitilessly.
‘How can you? That cannot be!’
And Sonia’s face worked with awful terror.
‘Cannot be?’ Raskolnikov went on with a harsh smile. 
‘You are not insured against it, are you? What will happen 
to them then? They will be in the street, all of them, she will 
cough and beg and knock her head against some wall, as 
she did to-day, and the children will cry…. Then she will 
fall down, be taken to the police station and to the hospital, 
she will die, and the children …’
‘Oh, no…. God will not let it be!’ broke at last from So -
nia’s overburdened bosom.
She listened, looking imploringly at him, clasping her 
hands in dumb entreaty, as though it all depended upon 
him.
Raskolnikov got up and began to walk about the room. A Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comminute passed. Sonia was standing with her hands and her 
head hanging in terrible dejection.
‘And can’t you save? Put by for a rainy day?’ he asked, 
stopping suddenly before her.
‘No,’ whispered Sonia.
‘Of course not. Have you tried?’ he added almost ironi -
cally.
‘Yes.’
‘And it didn’t come off! Of course not! No need to ask.’
And again he paced the room. Another minute passed.
‘You don’t get money every day?’
Sonia was more confused than ever and colour rushed 
into her face again.
‘No,’ she whispered with a painful effort.
‘It will be the same with Polenka, no doubt,’ he said sud -
denly.
‘No, no! It can’t be, no!’ Sonia cried aloud in desperation, 
as though she had been stabbed. ‘God would not allow any -
thing so awful!’
‘He lets others come to it.’
‘No, no! God will protect her, God!’ she repeated beside 
herself.
‘But, perhaps, there is no God at all,’ Raskolnikov an -
swered with a sort of malignance, laughed and looked at 
her.
Sonia’s face suddenly changed; a tremor passed over it. 
She looked at him with unutterable reproach, tried to say 
something, but could not speak and broke into bitter, bitter 
sobs, hiding her face in her hands.
Crime and Punishment ‘You say Katerina Ivanovna’s mind is unhinged; your 
own mind is unhinged,’ he said after a brief silence.
Five minutes passed. He still paced up and down the 
room in silence, not looking at her. At last he went up to her; 
his eyes glittered. He put his two hands on her shoulders 
and looked straight into her tearful face. His eyes were hard, 
feverish and piercing, his lips were twitching. All at once he 
bent down quickly and dropping to the ground, kissed her 
foot. Sonia drew back from him as from a madman. And 
certainly he looked like a madman.
‘What are you doing to me?’ she muttered, turning pale, 
and a sudden anguish clutched at her heart.
He stood up at once.
‘I did not bow down to you, I bowed down to all the suf -
fering of humanity,’ he said wildly and walked away to the 
window. ‘Listen,’ he added, turning to her a minute later. ‘I 
said just now to an insolent man that he was not worth your 
little finger … and that I did my sister honour making her 
sit beside you.’
‘Ach, you said that to them! And in her presence?’ cried 
Sonia, frightened. ‘Sit down with me! An honour! Why, I’m 
… dishonourable…. Ah, why did you say that?’
‘It was not because of your dishonour and your sin I said 
that of you, but because of your great suffering. But you are 
a great sinner, that’s true,’ he added almost solemnly, ‘and 
your worst sin is that you have destroyed and betrayed your -
self for nothing . Isn’t that fearful? Isn’t it fearful that you are 
living in this filth which you loathe so, and at the same time 
you know yourself (you’ve only to open your eyes) that you Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comare not helping anyone by it, not saving anyone from any -
thing? Tell me,’ he went on almost in a frenzy, ‘how this 
shame and degradation can exist in you side by side with 
other, opposite, holy feelings? It would be better, a thousand 
times better and wiser to leap into the water and end it all!’
‘But what would become of them?’ Sonia asked faintly, 
gazing at him with eyes of anguish, but not seeming sur -
prised at his suggestion.
Raskolnikov looked strangely at her. He read it all in her 
face; so she must have had that thought already, perhaps 
many times, and earnestly she had thought out in her de -
spair how to end it and so earnestly, that now she scarcely 
wondered at his suggestion. She had not even noticed the 
cruelty of his words. (The significance of his reproaches and 
his peculiar attitude to her shame she had, of course, not 
noticed either, and that, too, was clear to him.) But he saw 
how monstrously the thought of her disgraceful, shame -
ful position was torturing her and had long tortured her. 
‘What, what,’ he thought, ‘could hitherto have hindered her 
from putting an end to it?’ Only then he realised what those 
poor little orphan children and that pitiful half-crazy Kat -
erina Ivanovna, knocking her head against the wall in her 
consumption, meant for Sonia.
But, nevertheless, it was clear to him again that with her 
character and the amount of education she had after all re -
ceived, she could not in any case remain so. He was still 
confronted by the question, how could she have remained 
so long in that position without going out of her mind, 
since she could not bring herself to jump into the water?
Crime and Punishment Of course he knew that Sonia’s position was an exception -
al case, though unhappily not unique and not infrequent, 
indeed; but that very exceptionalness, her tinge of educa -
tion, her previous life might, one would have thought, have 
killed her at the first step on that revolting path. What held 
her up—surely not depravity? All that infamy had obvi -
ously only touched her mechanically, not one drop of real 
depravity had penetrated to her heart; he saw that. He saw 
through her as she stood before him….
‘There are three ways before her,’ he thought, ‘the canal, 
the madhouse, or … at last to sink into depravity which ob -
scures the mind and turns the heart to stone.’
The last idea was the most revolting, but he was a sceptic, 
he was young, abstract, and therefore cruel, and so he could 
not help believing that the last end was the most likely.
‘But can that be true?’ he cried to himself. ‘Can that 
creature who has still preserved the purity of her spirit be 
consciously drawn at last into that sink of filth and iniquity? 
Can the process already have begun? Can it be that she has 
only been able to bear it till now, because vice has begun to 
be less loathsome to her? No, no, that cannot be!’ he cried, 
as Sonia had just before. ‘No, what has kept her from the ca -
nal till now is the idea of sin and they, the children…. And 
if she has not gone out of her mind … but who says she has 
not gone out of her mind? Is she in her senses? Can one talk, 
can one reason as she does? How can she sit on the edge of 
the abyss of loathsomeness into which she is slipping and 
refuse to listen when she is told of danger? Does she expect 
a miracle? No doubt she does. Doesn’t that all mean mad - Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comness?’
He stayed obstinately at that thought. He liked that ex -
planation indeed better than any other. He began looking 
more intently at her.
‘So you pray to God a great deal, Sonia?’ he asked her.
Sonia did not speak; he stood beside her waiting for an 
answer.
‘What should I be without God?’ she whispered rapidly, 
forcibly, glancing at him with suddenly flashing eyes, and 
squeezing his hand.
‘Ah, so that is it!’ he thought.
‘And what does God do for you?’ he asked, probing her 
further.
Sonia was silent a long while, as though she could not 
answer. Her weak chest kept heaving with emotion.
‘Be silent! Don’t ask! You don’t deserve!’ she cried sud -
denly, looking sternly and wrathfully at him.
‘That’s it, that’s it,’ he repeated to himself.
‘He does everything,’ she whispered quickly, looking 
down again.
‘That’s the way out! That’s the explanation,’ he decided, 
scrutinising her with eager curiosity, with a new, strange, 
almost morbid feeling. He gazed at that pale, thin, irregular, 
angular little face, those soft blue eyes, which could flash 
with such fire, such stern energy, that little body still shak -
ing with indignation and anger—and it all seemed to him 
more and more strange, almost impossible. ‘She is a reli -
gious maniac!’ he repeated to himself.
There was a book lying on the chest of drawers. He had
Crime and Punishment 0noticed it every time he paced up and down the room. Now 
he took it up and looked at it. It was the New Testament 
in the Russian translation. It was bound in leather, old and 
worn.
‘Where did you get that?’ he called to her across the 
room.
She was still standing in the same place, three steps from 
the table.
‘It was brought me,’ she answered, as it were unwillingly, 
not looking at him.
‘Who brought it?’
‘Lizaveta, I asked her for it.’
‘Lizaveta! strange!’ he thought.
Everything about Sonia seemed to him stranger and 
more wonderful every moment. He carried the book to the 
candle and began to turn over the pages.
‘Where is the story of Lazarus?’ he asked suddenly.
Sonia looked obstinately at the ground and would not 
answer. She was standing sideways to the table.
‘Where is the raising of Lazarus? Find it for me, Sonia.’
She stole a glance at him.
‘You are not looking in the right place…. It’s in the fourth 
gospel,’ she whispered sternly, without looking at him.
‘Find it and read it to me,’ he said. He sat down with his 
elbow on the table, leaned his head on his hand and looked 
away sullenly, prepared to listen.
‘In three weeks’ time they’ll welcome me in the mad -
house! I shall be there if I am not in a worse place,’ he 
muttered to himself. Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comSonia heard Raskolnikov’s request distrustfully and 
moved hesitatingly to the table. She took the book however.
‘Haven’t you read it?’ she asked, looking up at him across 
the table.
Her voice became sterner and sterner.
‘Long ago…. When I was at school. Read!’
‘And haven’t you heard it in church?’
‘I … haven’t been. Do you often go?’
‘N-no,’ whispered Sonia.
Raskolnikov smiled.
‘I understand…. And you won’t go to your father’s fu -
neral to-morrow?’
‘Yes, I shall. I was at church last week, too … I had a re -
quiem service.’
‘For whom?’
‘For Lizaveta. She was killed with an axe.’
His nerves were more and more strained. His head be -
gan to go round.
‘Were you friends with Lizaveta?’
‘Yes…. She was good … she used to come … not often … 
she couldn’t…. We used to read together and … talk. She 
will see God.’
The last phrase sounded strange in his ears. And here 
was something new again: the mysterious meetings with 
Lizaveta and both of them— religious maniacs.
‘I shall be a religious maniac myself soon! It’s infectious!’
‘Read!’ he cried irritably and insistently.
Sonia still hesitated. Her heart was throbbing. She hard -
ly dared to read to him. He looked almost with exasperation
Crime and Punishment at the ‘unhappy lunatic.’
‘What for? You don’t believe? …’ she whispered softly 
and as it were breathlessly.
‘Read! I want you to,’ he persisted. ‘You used to read to 
Lizaveta.’
Sonia opened the book and found the place. Her hands 
were shaking, her voice failed her. Twice she tried to begin 
and could not bring out the first syllable.
‘Now a certain man was sick named Lazarus of Bethany 
…’ she forced herself at last to read, but at the third word her 
voice broke like an overstrained string. There was a catch 
in her breath.
Raskolnikov saw in part why Sonia could not bring 
herself to read to him and the more he saw this, the more 
roughly and irritably he insisted on her doing so. He un -
derstood only too well how painful it was for her to betray 
and unveil all that was her own . He understood that these 
feelings really were her secret treasure  which she had kept 
perhaps for years, perhaps from childhood, while she lived 
with an unhappy father and a distracted stepmother crazed 
by grief, in the midst of starving children and unseemly 
abuse and reproaches. But at the same time he knew now 
and knew for certain that, although it filled her with dread 
and suffering, yet she had a tormenting desire to read and to 
read to him that he might hear it, and to read now whatever 
might come of it! … He read this in her eyes, he could see it 
in her intense emotion. She mastered herself, controlled the 
spasm in her throat and went on reading the eleventh chap -
ter of St. John. She went on to the nineteenth verse: Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com‘And many of the Jews came to Martha and Mary to com -
fort them concerning their brother.
‘Then Martha as soon as she heard that Jesus was coming 
went and met Him: but Mary sat still in the house.
‘Then said Martha unto Jesus, Lord, if Thou hadst been 
here, my brother had not died.
‘But I know that even now whatsoever Thou wilt ask of 
God, God will give it Thee….’
Then she stopped again with a shamefaced feeling that 
her voice would quiver and break again.
‘Jesus said unto her, thy brother shall rise again.
‘Martha saith unto Him, I know that he shall rise again 
in the resurrection, at the last day.
‘Jesus said unto her, I am the resurrection and the life: he 
that believeth in Me though he were dead, yet shall he live.
‘And whosoever liveth and believeth in Me shall never 
die. Believest thou this?
‘She saith unto Him,’
(And drawing a painful breath, Sonia read distinctly and 
forcibly as though she were making a public confession of 
faith.)
‘Yea, Lord: I believe that Thou art the Christ, the Son of 
God Which should come into the world.’
She stopped and looked up quickly at him, but con -
trolling herself went on reading. Raskolnikov sat without 
moving, his elbows on the table and his eyes turned away. 
She read to the thirty-second verse.
‘Then when Mary was come where Jesus was and saw 
Him, she fell down at His feet, saying unto Him, Lord if
Crime and Punishment Thou hadst been here, my brother had not died.
‘When Jesus therefore saw her weeping, and the Jews also 
weeping which came with her, He groaned in the spirit and 
was troubled,
‘And said, Where have ye laid him? They said unto Him, 
Lord, come and see.
‘Jesus wept.
‘Then said the Jews, behold how He loved him!
‘And some of them said, could not this Man which opened 
the eyes of the blind, have caused that even this man should 
not have died?’
Raskolnikov turned and looked at her with emotion. 
Yes, he had known it! She was trembling in a real physi -
cal fever. He had expected it. She was getting near the story 
of the greatest miracle and a feeling of immense triumph 
came over her. Her voice rang out like a bell; triumph and 
joy gave it power. The lines danced before her eyes, but she 
knew what she was reading by heart. At the last verse ‘Could 
not this Man which opened the eyes of the blind …’ drop -
ping her voice she passionately reproduced the doubt, the 
reproach and censure of the blind disbelieving Jews, who 
in another moment would fall at His feet as though struck 
by thunder, sobbing and believing…. ‘And he, he —too, is 
blinded and unbelieving, he, too, will hear, he, too, will be -
lieve, yes, yes! At once, now,’ was what she was dreaming, 
and she was quivering with happy anticipation.
‘Jesus therefore again groaning in Himself cometh to the 
grave. It was a cave, and a stone lay upon it.
‘Jesus said, Take ye away the stone. Martha, the sister of Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comhim that was dead, saith unto Him, Lord by this time he 
stinketh: for he hath been dead four days.’
She laid emphasis on the word four.
‘Jesus saith unto her, Said I not unto thee that if thou 
wouldest believe, thou shouldest see the glory of God?
‘Then they took away the stone from the place where the 
dead was laid. And Jesus lifted up His eyes and said, Father, 
I thank Thee that Thou hast heard Me.
‘And I knew that Thou hearest Me always; but because 
of the people which stand by I said it, that they may believe 
that Thou hast sent Me.
‘And when He thus had spoken, He cried with a loud 
voice, Lazarus, come forth.
‘And he that was dead came forth.’
(She read loudly, cold and trembling with ecstasy, as 
though she were seeing it before her eyes.)
‘Bound hand and foot with graveclothes; and his face was 
bound about with a napkin. Jesus saith unto them, Loose 
him and let him go.
‘Then many of the Jews which came to Mary and had 
seen the things which Jesus did believed on Him.’
She could read no more, closed the book and got up from 
her chair quickly.
‘That is all about the raising of Lazarus,’ she whispered 
severely and abruptly, and turning away she stood motion -
less, not daring to raise her eyes to him. She still trembled 
feverishly. The candle-end was flickering out in the battered 
candlestick, dimly lighting up in the poverty-stricken room 
the murderer and the harlot who had so strangely been read -
Crime and Punishment ing together the eternal book. Five minutes or more passed.
‘I came to speak of something,’ Raskolnikov said aloud, 
frowning. He got up and went to Sonia. She lifted her eyes 
to him in silence. His face was particularly stern and there 
was a sort of savage determination in it.
‘I have abandoned my family to-day,’ he said, ‘my moth -
er and sister. I am not going to see them. I’ve broken with 
them completely.’
‘What for?’ asked Sonia amazed. Her recent meeting with 
his mother and sister had left a great impression which she 
could not analyse. She heard his news almost with horror.
‘I have only you now,’ he added. ‘Let us go together…. I’ve 
come to you, we are both accursed, let us go our way to -
gether!’
His eyes glittered ‘as though he were mad,’ Sonia thought, 
in her turn.
‘Go where?’ she asked in alarm and she involuntarily 
stepped back.
‘How do I know? I only know it’s the same road, I know 
that and nothing more. It’s the same goal!’
She looked at him and understood nothing. She knew 
only that he was terribly, infinitely unhappy.
‘No one of them will understand, if you tell them, but 
I have understood. I need you, that is why I have come to 
you.’
‘I don’t understand,’ whispered Sonia.
‘You’ll understand later. Haven’t you done the same? You, 
too, have transgressed … have had the strength to trans -
gress. You have laid hands on yourself, you have destroyed Free eBooks at Planet eBook.coma life … your own  (it’s all the same!). You might have lived 
in spirit and understanding, but you’ll end in the Hay Mar -
ket…. But you won’t be able to stand it, and if you remain 
alone you’ll go out of your mind like me. You are like a mad 
creature already. So we must go together on the same road! 
Let us go!’
‘What for? What’s all this for?’ said Sonia, strangely and 
violently agitated by his words.
‘What for? Because you can’t remain like this, that’s why! 
You must look things straight in the face at last, and not 
weep like a child and cry that God won’t allow it. What will 
happen, if you should really be taken to the hospital to-mor -
row? She is mad and in consumption, she’ll soon die and 
the children? Do you mean to tell me Polenka won’t come 
to grief? Haven’t you seen children here at the street cor -
ners sent out by their mothers to beg? I’ve found out where 
those mothers live and in what surroundings. Children 
can’t remain children there! At seven the child is vicious 
and a thief. Yet children, you know, are the image of Christ: 
‘theirs is the kingdom of Heaven.’ He bade us honour and 
love them, they are the humanity of the future….’
‘What’s to be done, what’s to be done?’ repeated Sonia, 
weeping hysterically and wringing her hands.
‘What’s to be done? Break what must be broken, once for 
all, that’s all, and take the suffering on oneself. What, you 
don’t understand? You’ll understand later…. Freedom and 
power, and above all, power! Over all trembling creation 
and all the ant-heap! … That’s the goal, remember that! 
That’s my farewell message. Perhaps it’s the last time I shall
Crime and Punishment speak to you. If I don’t come to-morrow, you’ll hear of it 
all, and then remember these words. And some day later 
on, in years to come, you’ll understand perhaps what they 
meant. If I come to-morrow, I’ll tell you who killed Liza -
veta…. Good-bye.’
Sonia started with terror.
‘Why, do you know who killed her?’ she asked, chilled 
with horror, looking wildly at him.
‘I know and will tell … you, only you. I have chosen you 
out. I’m not coming to you to ask forgiveness, but simply to 
tell you. I chose you out long ago to hear this, when your fa -
ther talked of you and when Lizaveta was alive, I thought of 
it. Good-bye, don’t shake hands. To-morrow!’
He went out. Sonia gazed at him as at a madman. But 
she herself was like one insane and felt it. Her head was go -
ing round.
‘Good heavens, how does he know who killed Lizaveta? 
What did those words mean? It’s awful!’ But at the same 
time the idea  did not enter her head, not for a moment! 
‘Oh, he must be terribly unhappy! … He has abandoned his 
mother and sister…. What for? What has happened? And 
what had he in his mind? What did he say to her? He had 
kissed her foot and said … said (yes, he had said it clearly) 
that he could not live without her…. Oh, merciful heavens!’
Sonia spent the whole night feverish and delirious. She 
jumped up from time to time, wept and wrung her hands, 
then sank again into feverish sleep and dreamt of Polenka, 
Katerina Ivanovna and Lizaveta, of reading the gospel and 
him … him with pale face, with burning eyes … kissing her Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comfeet, weeping.
On the other side of the door on the right, which divid -
ed Sonia’s room from Madame Resslich’s flat, was a room 
which had long stood empty. A card was fixed on the gate 
and a notice stuck in the windows over the canal advertis -
ing it to let. Sonia had long been accustomed to the room’s 
being uninhabited. But all that time Mr. Svidrigaïlov had 
been standing, listening at the door of the empty room. 
When Raskolnikov went out he stood still, thought a mo -
ment, went on tiptoe to his own room which adjoined the 
empty one, brought a chair and noiselessly carried it to the 
door that led to Sonia’s room. The conversation had struck 
him as interesting and remarkable, and he had greatly en -
joyed it—so much so that he brought a chair that he might 
not in the future, to-morrow, for instance, have to endure 
the inconvenience of standing a whole hour, but might lis -
ten in comfort.
Crime and Punishment 0Chapter V
When next morning at eleven o’clock punctually Raskol -
nikov went into the department of the investigation 
of criminal causes and sent his name in to Porfiry Petro -
vitch, he was surprised at being kept waiting so long: it was 
at least ten minutes before he was summoned. He had ex -
pected that they would pounce upon him. But he stood in 
the waiting- room, and people, who apparently had nothing 
to do with him, were continually passing to and fro before 
him. In the next room which looked like an office, several 
clerks were sitting writing and obviously they had no no -
tion who or what Raskolnikov might be. He looked uneasily 
and suspiciously about him to see whether there was not 
some guard, some mysterious watch being kept on him to 
prevent his escape. But there was nothing of the sort: he 
saw only the faces of clerks absorbed in petty details, then 
other people, no one seemed to have any concern with him. 
He might go where he liked for them. The conviction grew 
stronger in him that if that enigmatic man of yesterday, that 
phantom sprung out of the earth, had seen everything, they 
would not have let him stand and wait like that. And would 
they have waited till he elected to appear at eleven? Either 
the man had not yet given information, or … or simply he 
knew nothing, had seen nothing (and how could he have 
seen anything?) and so all that had happened to him the Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comday before was again a phantom exaggerated by his sick and 
overstrained imagination. This conjecture had begun to 
grow strong the day before, in the midst of all his alarm and 
despair. Thinking it all over now and preparing for a fresh 
conflict, he was suddenly aware that he was trembling—
and he felt a rush of indignation at the thought that he was 
trembling with fear at facing that hateful Porfiry Petrovitch. 
What he dreaded above all was meeting that man again; he 
hated him with an intense, unmitigated hatred and was 
afraid his hatred might betray him. His indignation was 
such that he ceased trembling at once; he made ready to go 
in with a cold and arrogant bearing and vowed to himself to 
keep as silent as possible, to watch and listen and for once at 
least to control his overstrained nerves. At that moment he 
was summoned to Porfiry Petrovitch.
He found Porfiry Petrovitch alone in his study. His 
study was a room neither large nor small, furnished with 
a large writing-table, that stood before a sofa, upholstered 
in checked material, a bureau, a bookcase in the corner 
and several chairs—all government furniture, of polished 
yellow wood. In the further wall there was a closed door, be -
yond it there were no doubt other rooms. On Raskolnikov’s 
entrance Porfiry Petrovitch had at once closed the door by 
which he had come in and they remained alone. He met his 
visitor with an apparently genial and good-tempered air, 
and it was only after a few minutes that Raskolnikov saw 
signs of a certain awkwardness in him, as though he had 
been thrown out of his reckoning or caught in something 
very secret.
Crime and Punishment ‘Ah, my dear fellow! Here you are … in our domain’ … 
began Porfiry, holding out both hands to him. ‘Come, sit 
down, old man … or perhaps you don’t like to be called ‘my 
dear fellow’ and ‘old man!’—/tout court? Please don’t think 
it too familiar…. Here, on the sofa.’
Raskolnikov sat down, keeping his eyes fixed on him. 
‘In our domain,’ the apologies for familiarity, the French 
phrase tout court  were all characteristic signs.
‘He held out both hands to me, but he did not give me 
one—he drew it back in time,’ struck him suspiciously. Both 
were watching each other, but when their eyes met, quick as 
lightning they looked away.
‘I brought you this paper … about the watch. Here it is. Is 
it all right or shall I copy it again?’
‘What? A paper? Yes, yes, don’t be uneasy, it’s all right,’ 
Porfiry Petrovitch said as though in haste, and after he had 
said it he took the paper and looked at it. ‘Yes, it’s all right. 
Nothing more is needed,’ he declared with the same rapid -
ity and he laid the paper on the table.
A minute later when he was talking of something else he 
took it from the table and put it on his bureau.
‘I believe you said yesterday you would like to question 
me … formally … about my acquaintance with the mur -
dered woman?’ Raskolnikov was beginning again. ‘Why 
did I put in ‘I believe’’ passed through his mind in a flash. 
‘Why am I so uneasy at having put in that ‘ I believe ’?’ came 
in a second flash. And he suddenly felt that his uneasiness at 
the mere contact with Porfiry, at the first words, at the first 
looks, had grown in an instant to monstrous proportions, Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comand that this was fearfully dangerous. His nerves were 
quivering, his emotion was increasing. ‘It’s bad, it’s bad! I 
shall say too much again.’
‘Yes, yes, yes! There’s no hurry, there’s no hurry,’ muttered 
Porfiry Petrovitch, moving to and fro about the table with -
out any apparent aim, as it were making dashes towards the 
window, the bureau and the table, at one moment avoiding 
Raskolnikov’s suspicious glance, then again standing still 
and looking him straight in the face.
His fat round little figure looked very strange, like a ball 
rolling from one side to the other and rebounding back.
‘We’ve plenty of time. Do you smoke? have you your own? 
Here, a cigarette!’ he went on, offering his visitor a cigarette. 
‘You know I am receiving you here, but my own quarters 
are through there, you know, my government quarters. But 
I am living outside for the time, I had to have some repairs 
done here. It’s almost finished now…. Government quar -
ters, you know, are a capital thing. Eh, what do you think?’
‘Yes, a capital thing,’ answered Raskolnikov, looking at 
him almost ironically.
‘A capital thing, a capital thing,’ repeated Porfiry Petro -
vitch, as though he had just thought of something quite 
different. ‘Yes, a capital thing,’ he almost shouted at last, 
suddenly staring at Raskolnikov and stopping short two 
steps from him.
This stupid repetition was too incongruous in its inepti -
tude with the serious, brooding and enigmatic glance he 
turned upon his visitor.
But this stirred Raskolnikov’s spleen more than ever and
Crime and Punishment he could not resist an ironical and rather incautious chal -
lenge.
‘Tell me, please,’ he asked suddenly, looking almost in -
solently at him and taking a kind of pleasure in his own 
insolence. ‘I believe it’s a sort of legal rule, a sort of legal tra -
dition—for all investigating lawyers—to begin their attack 
from afar, with a trivial, or at least an irrelevant subject, so 
as to encourage, or rather, to divert the man they are cross-
examining, to disarm his caution and then all at once to 
give him an unexpected knock-down blow with some fatal 
question. Isn’t that so? It’s a sacred tradition, mentioned, I 
fancy, in all the manuals of the art?’
‘Yes, yes…. Why, do you imagine that was why I spoke 
about government quarters … eh?’
And as he said this Porfiry Petrovitch screwed up his 
eyes and winked; a good-humoured, crafty look passed 
over his face. The wrinkles on his forehead were smoothed 
out, his eyes contracted, his features broadened and he sud -
denly went off into a nervous prolonged laugh, shaking all 
over and looking Raskolnikov straight in the face. The latter 
forced himself to laugh, too, but when Porfiry, seeing that 
he was laughing, broke into such a guffaw that he turned 
almost crimson, Raskolnikov’s repulsion overcame all pre -
caution; he left off laughing, scowled and stared with hatred 
at Porfiry, keeping his eyes fixed on him while his intention -
ally prolonged laughter lasted. There was lack of precaution 
on both sides, however, for Porfiry Petrovitch seemed to be 
laughing in his visitor’s face and to be very little disturbed 
at the annoyance with which the visitor received it. The lat - Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comter fact was very significant in Raskolnikov’s eyes: he saw 
that Porfiry Petrovitch had not been embarrassed just be -
fore either, but that he, Raskolnikov, had perhaps fallen into 
a trap; that there must be something, some motive here un -
known to him; that, perhaps, everything was in readiness 
and in another moment would break upon him …
He went straight to the point at once, rose from his seat 
and took his cap.
‘Porfiry Petrovitch,’ he began resolutely, though with 
considerable irritation, ‘yesterday you expressed a desire 
that I should come to you for some inquiries’ (he laid spe -
cial stress on the word ‘inquiries’). ‘I have come and if you 
have anything to ask me, ask it, and if not, allow me to with -
draw. I have no time to spare…. I have to be at the funeral 
of that man who was run over, of whom you … know also,’ 
he added, feeling angry at once at having made this addi -
tion and more irritated at his anger. ‘I am sick of it all, do 
you hear? and have long been. It’s partly what made me ill. 
In short,’ he shouted, feeling that the phrase about his ill -
ness was still more out of place, ‘in short, kindly examine 
me or let me go, at once. And if you must examine me, do so 
in the proper form! I will not allow you to do so otherwise, 
and so meanwhile, good-bye, as we have evidently nothing 
to keep us now.’
‘Good heavens! What do you mean? What shall I ques -
tion you about?’ cackled Porfiry Petrovitch with a change 
of tone, instantly leaving off laughing. ‘Please don’t disturb 
yourself,’ he began fidgeting from place to place and fussily 
making Raskolnikov sit down. ‘There’s no hurry, there’s no
Crime and Punishment hurry, it’s all nonsense. Oh, no, I’m very glad you’ve come 
to see me at last … I look upon you simply as a visitor. And 
as for my confounded laughter, please excuse it, Rodion 
Romanovitch. Rodion Romanovitch? That is your name? 
… It’s my nerves, you tickled me so with your witty obser -
vation; I assure you, sometimes I shake with laughter like 
an india-rubber ball for half an hour at a time…. I’m often 
afraid of an attack of paralysis. Do sit down. Please do, or I 
shall think you are angry …’
Raskolnikov did not speak; he listened, watching him, 
still frowning angrily. He did sit down, but still held his 
cap.
‘I must tell you one thing about myself, my dear Rodion 
Romanovitch,’ Porfiry Petrovitch continued, moving about 
the room and again avoiding his visitor’s eyes. ‘You see, I’m 
a bachelor, a man of no consequence and not used to soci -
ety; besides, I have nothing before me, I’m set, I’m running 
to seed and … and have you noticed, Rodion Romanovitch, 
that in our Petersburg circles, if two clever men meet who 
are not intimate, but respect each other, like you and me, it 
takes them half an hour before they can find a subject for 
conversation—they are dumb, they sit opposite each oth -
er and feel awkward. Everyone has subjects of conversation, 
ladies for instance … people in high society always have 
their subjects of conversation, c’est de rigueur  but people of 
the middle sort like us, thinking people that is, are always 
tongue-tied and awkward. What is the reason of it? Wheth -
er it is the lack of public interest, or whether it is we are so 
honest we don’t want to deceive one another, I don’t know. Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comWhat do you think? Do put down your cap, it looks as if 
you were just going, it makes me uncomfortable … I am so 
delighted …’
Raskolnikov put down his cap and continued listening 
in silence with a serious frowning face to the vague and 
empty chatter of Porfiry Petrovitch. ‘Does he really want to 
distract my attention with his silly babble?’
‘I can’t offer you coffee here; but why not spend five min -
utes with a friend?’ Porfiry pattered on, ‘and you know all 
these official duties … please don’t mind my running up 
and down, excuse it, my dear fellow, I am very much afraid 
of offending you, but exercise is absolutely indispensable for 
me. I’m always sitting and so glad to be moving about for 
five minutes … I suffer from my sedentary life … I always 
intend to join a gymnasium; they say that officials of all 
ranks, even Privy Councillors, may be seen skipping gaily 
there; there you have it, modern science … yes, yes…. But 
as for my duties here, inquiries and all such formalities … 
you mentioned inquiries yourself just now … I assure you 
these interrogations are sometimes more embarrassing for 
the interrogator than for the interrogated…. You made the 
observation yourself just now very aptly and wittily.’ (Ras -
kolnikov had made no observation of the kind.) ‘One gets 
into a muddle! A regular muddle! One keeps harping on 
the same note, like a drum! There is to be a reform and we 
shall be called by a different name, at least, he-he-he! And 
as for our legal tradition, as you so wittily called it, I thor -
oughly agree with you. Every prisoner on trial, even the 
rudest peasant, knows that they begin by disarming him
Crime and Punishment with irrelevant questions (as you so happily put it) and then 
deal him a knock-down blow, he-he-he!—your felicitous 
comparison, he-he! So you really imagined that I meant by 
‘government quarters’ … he-he! You are an ironical person. 
Come. I won’t go on! Ah, by the way, yes! One word leads 
to another. You spoke of formality just now, apropos of the 
inquiry, you know. But what’s the use of formality? In many 
cases it’s nonsense. Sometimes one has a friendly chat and 
gets a good deal more out of it. One can always fall back on 
formality, allow me to assure you. And after all, what does 
it amount to? An examining lawyer cannot be bounded by 
formality at every step. The work of investigation is, so to 
speak, a free art in its own way, he-he-he!’
Porfiry Petrovitch took breath a moment. He had sim -
ply babbled on uttering empty phrases, letting slip a few 
enigmatic words and again reverting to incoherence. He 
was almost running about the room, moving his fat little 
legs quicker and quicker, looking at the ground, with his 
right hand behind his back, while with his left making ges -
ticulations that were extraordinarily incongruous with his 
words. Raskolnikov suddenly noticed that as he ran about 
the room he seemed twice to stop for a moment near the 
door, as though he were listening.
‘Is he expecting anything?’
‘You are certainly quite right about it,’ Porfiry began 
gaily, looking with extraordinary simplicity at Raskol -
nikov (which startled him and instantly put him on his 
guard); ‘certainly quite right in laughing so wittily at our 
legal forms, he-he! Some of these elaborate psychological Free eBooks at Planet eBook.commethods are exceedingly ridiculous and perhaps useless, if 
one adheres too closely to the forms. Yes … I am talking of 
forms again. Well, if I recognise, or more strictly speaking, 
if I suspect someone or other to be a criminal in any case 
entrusted to me … you’re reading for the law, of course, Ro -
dion Romanovitch?’
‘Yes, I was …’
‘Well, then it is a precedent for you for the future—though 
don’t suppose I should venture to instruct you after the ar -
ticles you publish about crime! No, I simply make bold to 
state it by way of fact, if I took this man or that for a criminal, 
why, I ask, should I worry him prematurely, even though I 
had evidence against him? In one case I may be bound, for 
instance, to arrest a man at once, but another may be in 
quite a different position, you know, so why shouldn’t I let 
him walk about the town a bit? he-he-he! But I see you don’t 
quite understand, so I’ll give you a clearer example. If I put 
him in prison too soon, I may very likely give him, so to 
speak, moral support, he-he! You’re laughing?’
Raskolnikov had no idea of laughing. He was sitting with 
compressed lips, his feverish eyes fixed on Porfiry Petro -
vitch’s.
‘Yet that is the case, with some types especially, for men 
are so different. You say ‘evidence’. Well, there may be evi -
dence. But evidence, you know, can generally be taken two 
ways. I am an examining lawyer and a weak man, I confess 
it. I should like to make a proof, so to say, mathematical -
ly clear. I should like to make a chain of evidence such as 
twice two are four, it ought to be a direct, irrefutable proof!
Crime and Punishment 0And if I shut him up too soon—even though I might be con -
vinced he was the man, I should very likely be depriving 
myself of the means of getting further evidence against him. 
And how? By giving him, so to speak, a definite position, I 
shall put him out of suspense and set his mind at rest, so 
that he will retreat into his shell. They say that at Sevastopol, 
soon after Alma, the clever people were in a terrible fright 
that the enemy would attack openly and take Sevastopol at 
once. But when they saw that the enemy preferred a regular 
siege, they were delighted, I am told and reassured, for the 
thing would drag on for two months at least. You’re laugh -
ing, you don’t believe me again? Of course, you’re right, too. 
You’re right, you’re right. These are special cases, I admit. 
But you must observe this, my dear Rodion Romanovitch, 
the general case, the case for which all legal forms and rules 
are intended, for which they are calculated and laid down 
in books, does not exist at all, for the reason that every case, 
every crime, for instance, so soon as it actually occurs, at 
once becomes a thoroughly special case and sometimes a 
case unlike any that’s gone before. Very comic cases of that 
sort sometimes occur. If I leave one man quite alone, if I 
don’t touch him and don’t worry him, but let him know or 
at least suspect every moment that I know all about it and 
am watching him day and night, and if he is in continual 
suspicion and terror, he’ll be bound to lose his head. He’ll 
come of himself, or maybe do something which will make 
it as plain as twice two are four—it’s delightful. It may be 
so with a simple peasant, but with one of our sort, an intel -
ligent man cultivated on a certain side, it’s a dead certainty. Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comFor, my dear fellow, it’s a very important matter to know on 
what side a man is cultivated. And then there are nerves, 
there are nerves, you have overlooked them! Why, they are 
all sick, nervous and irritable! … And then how they all 
suffer from spleen! That I assure you is a regular gold-mine 
for us. And it’s no anxiety to me, his running about the 
town free! Let him, let him walk about for a bit! I know well 
enough that I’ve caught him and that he won’t escape me. 
Where could he escape to, he-he? Abroad, perhaps? A Pole 
will escape abroad, but not here, especially as I am watching 
and have taken measures. Will he escape into the depths of 
the country perhaps? But you know, peasants live there, real 
rude Russian peasants. A modern cultivated man would 
prefer prison to living with such strangers as our peasants. 
He-he! But that’s all nonsense, and on the surface. It’s not 
merely that he has nowhere to run to, he is psychologically  
unable to escape me, he-he! What an expression! Through 
a law of nature he can’t escape me if he had anywhere to go. 
Have you seen a butterfly round a candle? That’s how he will 
keep circling and circling round me. Freedom will lose its 
attractions. He’ll begin to brood, he’ll weave a tangle round 
himself, he’ll worry himself to death! What’s more he will 
provide me with a mathematical proof—if I only give him 
long enough interval…. And he’ll keep circling round me, 
getting nearer and nearer and then—flop! He’ll fly straight 
into my mouth and I’ll swallow him, and that will be very 
amusing, he-he-he! You don’t believe me?’
Raskolnikov made no reply; he sat pale and motionless, 
still gazing with the same intensity into Porfiry’s face.
Crime and Punishment ‘It’s a lesson,’ he thought, turning cold. ‘This is beyond 
the cat playing with a mouse, like yesterday. He can’t be 
showing off his power with no motive … prompting me; 
he is far too clever for that … he must have another object. 
What is it? It’s all nonsense, my friend, you are pretending, 
to scare me! You’ve no proofs and the man I saw had no 
real existence. You simply want to make me lose my head, 
to work me up beforehand and so to crush me. But you are 
wrong, you won’t do it! But why give me such a hint? Is he 
reckoning on my shattered nerves? No, my friend, you are 
wrong, you won’t do it even though you have some trap for 
me … let us see what you have in store for me.’
And he braced himself to face a terrible and unknown or -
deal. At times he longed to fall on Porfiry and strangle him. 
This anger was what he dreaded from the beginning. He felt 
that his parched lips were flecked with foam, his heart was 
throbbing. But he was still determined not to speak till the 
right moment. He realised that this was the best policy in 
his position, because instead of saying too much he would 
be irritating his enemy by his silence and provoking him 
into speaking too freely. Anyhow, this was what he hoped 
for.
‘No, I see you don’t believe me, you think I am playing 
a harmless joke on you,’ Porfiry began again, getting more 
and more lively, chuckling at every instant and again pac -
ing round the room. ‘And to be sure you’re right: God has 
given me a figure that can awaken none but comic ideas in 
other people; a buffoon; but let me tell you, and I repeat it, 
excuse an old man, my dear Rodion Romanovitch, you are a Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comman still young, so to say, in your first youth and so you put 
intellect above everything, like all young people. Playful wit 
and abstract arguments fascinate you and that’s for all the 
world like the old Austrian Hof-kriegsrath  as far as I can 
judge of military matters, that is: on paper they’d beaten 
Napoleon and taken him prisoner, and there in their study 
they worked it all out in the cleverest fashion, but look you, 
General Mack surrendered with all his army, he-he-he! I 
see, I see, Rodion Romanovitch, you are laughing at a civil -
ian like me, taking examples out of military history! But I 
can’t help it, it’s my weakness. I am fond of military science. 
And I’m ever so fond of reading all military histories. I’ve 
certainly missed my proper career. I ought to have been in 
the army, upon my word I ought. I shouldn’t have been a 
Napoleon, but I might have been a major, he-he! Well, I’ll 
tell you the whole truth, my dear fellow, about this special 
case I mean: actual fact and a man’s temperament, my dear 
sir, are weighty matters and it’s astonishing how they some -
times deceive the sharpest calculation! I—listen to an old 
man—am speaking seriously, Rodion Romanovitch’ (as 
he said this Porfiry Petrovitch, who was scarcely five-and-
thirty, actually seemed to have grown old; even his voice 
changed and he seemed to shrink together) ‘Moreover, I’m a 
candid man … am I a candid man or not? What do you say? 
I fancy I really am: I tell you these things for nothing and 
don’t even expect a reward for it, he-he! Well, to proceed, wit 
in my opinion is a splendid thing, it is, so to say, an adorn -
ment of nature and a consolation of life, and what tricks it 
can play! So that it sometimes is hard for a poor examining
Crime and Punishment lawyer to know where he is, especially when he’s liable to 
be carried away by his own fancy, too, for you know he is a 
man after all! But the poor fellow is saved by the criminal’s 
temperament, worse luck for him! But young people carried 
away by their own wit don’t think of that ‘when they over -
step all obstacles,’ as you wittily and cleverly expressed it 
yesterday. He will lie—that is, the man who is a special case  
the incognito, and he will lie well, in the cleverest fashion; 
you might think he would triumph and enjoy the fruits of 
his wit, but at the most interesting, the most flagrant mo -
ment he will faint. Of course there may be illness and a 
stuffy room as well, but anyway! Anyway he’s given us the 
idea! He lied incomparably, but he didn’t reckon on his tem -
perament. That’s what betrays him! Another time he will be 
carried away by his playful wit into making fun of the man 
who suspects him, he will turn pale as it were on purpose to 
mislead, but his paleness will be too natural  too much like 
the real thing, again he has given us an idea! Though his 
questioner may be deceived at first, he will think differently 
next day if he is not a fool, and, of course, it is like that at 
every step! He puts himself forward where he is not want -
ed, speaks continually when he ought to keep silent, brings 
in all sorts of allegorical allusions, he-he! Comes and asks 
why didn’t you take me long ago? he-he-he! And that can 
happen, you know, with the cleverest man, the psychologist, 
the literary man. The temperament reflects everything like 
a mirror! Gaze into it and admire what you see! But why are 
you so pale, Rodion Romanovitch? Is the room stuffy? Shall 
I open the window?’ Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com‘Oh, don’t trouble, please,’ cried Raskolnikov and he sud -
denly broke into a laugh. ‘Please don’t trouble.’
Porfiry stood facing him, paused a moment and suddenly 
he too laughed. Raskolnikov got up from the sofa, abruptly 
checking his hysterical laughter.
‘Porfiry Petrovitch,’ he began, speaking loudly and dis -
tinctly, though his legs trembled and he could scarcely 
stand. ‘I see clearly at last that you actually suspect me of 
murdering that old woman and her sister Lizaveta. Let me 
tell you for my part that I am sick of this. If you find that 
you have a right to prosecute me legally, to arrest me, then 
prosecute me, arrest me. But I will not let myself be jeered 
at to my face and worried …’
His lips trembled, his eyes glowed with fury and he could 
not restrain his voice.
‘I won’t allow it!’ he shouted, bringing his fist down on 
the table. ‘Do you hear that, Porfiry Petrovitch? I won’t al -
low it.’
‘Good heavens! What does it mean?’ cried Porfiry Petro -
vitch, apparently quite frightened. ‘Rodion Romanovitch, 
my dear fellow, what is the matter with you?’
‘I won’t allow it,’ Raskolnikov shouted again.
‘Hush, my dear man! They’ll hear and come in. Just think, 
what could we say to them?’ Porfiry Petrovitch whispered in 
horror, bringing his face close to Raskolnikov’s.
‘I won’t allow it, I won’t allow it,’ Raskolnikov repeated 
mechanically, but he too spoke in a sudden whisper.
Porfiry turned quickly and ran to open the window.
‘Some fresh air! And you must have some water, my dear
Crime and Punishment fellow. You’re ill!’ and he was running to the door to call 
for some when he found a decanter of water in the corner. 
‘Come, drink a little,’ he whispered, rushing up to him with 
the decanter. ‘It will be sure to do you good.’
Porfiry Petrovitch’s alarm and sympathy were so natural 
that Raskolnikov was silent and began looking at him with 
wild curiosity. He did not take the water, however.
‘Rodion Romanovitch, my dear fellow, you’ll drive your -
self out of your mind, I assure you, ach, ach! Have some 
water, do drink a little.’
He forced him to take the glass. Raskolnikov raised it 
mechanically to his lips, but set it on the table again with 
disgust.
‘Yes, you’ve had a little attack! You’ll bring back your ill -
ness again, my dear fellow,’ Porfiry Petrovitch cackled with 
friendly sympathy, though he still looked rather discon -
certed. ‘Good heavens, you must take more care of yourself! 
Dmitri Prokofitch was here, came to see me yesterday—I 
know, I know, I’ve a nasty, ironical temper, but what they 
made of it! … Good heavens, he came yesterday after you’d 
been. We dined and he talked and talked away, and I could 
only throw up my hands in despair! Did he come from you? 
But do sit down, for mercy’s sake, sit down!’
‘No, not from me, but I knew he went to you and why he 
went,’ Raskolnikov answered sharply.
‘You knew?’
‘I knew. What of it?’
‘Why this, Rodion Romanovitch, that I know more than 
that about you; I know about everything. I know how you Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comwent to take a flat  at night when it was dark and how you 
rang the bell and asked about the blood, so that the work -
men and the porter did not know what to make of it. Yes, 
I understand your state of mind at that time … but you’ll 
drive yourself mad like that, upon my word! You’ll lose your 
head! You’re full of generous indignation at the wrongs 
you’ve received, first from destiny, and then from the police 
officers, and so you rush from one thing to another to force 
them to speak out and make an end of it all, because you 
are sick of all this suspicion and foolishness. That’s so, isn’t 
it? I have guessed how you feel, haven’t I? Only in that way 
you’ll lose your head and Razumihin’s, too; he’s too good  
a man for such a position, you must know that. You are ill 
and he is good and your illness is infectious for him … I’ll 
tell you about it when you are more yourself…. But do sit 
down, for goodness’ sake. Please rest, you look shocking, do 
sit down.’
Raskolnikov sat down; he no longer shivered, he was 
hot all over. In amazement he listened with strained atten -
tion to Porfiry Petrovitch who still seemed frightened as he 
looked after him with friendly solicitude. But he did not be -
lieve a word he said, though he felt a strange inclination to 
believe. Porfiry’s unexpected words about the flat had ut -
terly overwhelmed him. ‘How can it be, he knows about the 
flat then,’ he thought suddenly, ‘and he tells it me himself!’
‘Yes, in our legal practice there was a case almost exact -
ly similar, a case of morbid psychology,’ Porfiry went on 
quickly. ‘A man confessed to murder and how he kept it up! 
It was a regular hallucination; he brought forward facts, he
Crime and Punishment imposed upon everyone and why? He had been partly, but 
only partly, unintentionally the cause of a murder and when 
he knew that he had given the murderers the opportunity, 
he sank into dejection, it got on his mind and turned his 
brain, he began imagining things and he persuaded him -
self that he was the murderer. But at last the High Court of 
Appeal went into it and the poor fellow was acquitted and 
put under proper care. Thanks to the Court of Appeal! Tut-
tut-tut! Why, my dear fellow, you may drive yourself into 
delirium if you have the impulse to work upon your nerves, 
to go ringing bells at night and asking about blood! I’ve 
studied all this morbid psychology in my practice. A man 
is sometimes tempted to jump out of a window or from a 
belfry. Just the same with bell-ringing…. It’s all illness, Ro -
dion Romanovitch! You have begun to neglect your illness. 
You should consult an experienced doctor, what’s the good 
of that fat fellow? You are lightheaded! You were delirious 
when you did all this!’
For a moment Raskolnikov felt everything going round.
‘Is it possible, is it possible,’ flashed through his mind, 
‘that he is still lying? He can’t be, he can’t be.’ He rejected 
that idea, feeling to what a degree of fury it might drive him, 
feeling that that fury might drive him mad.
‘I was not delirious. I knew what I was doing,’ he cried, 
straining every faculty to penetrate Porfiry’s game, ‘I was 
quite myself, do you hear?’
‘Yes, I hear and understand. You said yesterday you 
were not delirious, you were particularly emphatic about 
it! I understand all you can tell me! A-ach! … Listen, Ro - Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comdion Romanovitch, my dear fellow. If you were actually 
a criminal, or were somehow mixed up in this damnable 
business, would you insist that you were not delirious but in 
full possession of your faculties? And so emphatically and 
persistently? Would it be possible? Quite impossible, to my 
thinking. If you had anything on your conscience, you cer -
tainly ought to insist that you were delirious. That’s so, isn’t 
it?’
There was a note of slyness in this inquiry. Raskolnikov 
drew back on the sofa as Porfiry bent over him and stared 
in silent perplexity at him.
‘Another thing about Razumihin—you certainly ought 
to have said that he came of his own accord, to have con -
cealed your part in it! But you don’t conceal it! You lay stress 
on his coming at your instigation.’
Raskolnikov had not done so. A chill went down his 
back.
‘You keep telling lies,’ he said slowly and weakly, twisting 
his lips into a sickly smile, ‘you are trying again to show that 
you know all my game, that you know all I shall say before -
hand,’ he said, conscious himself that he was not weighing 
his words as he ought. ‘You want to frighten me … or you 
are simply laughing at me …’
He still stared at him as he said this and again there was 
a light of intense hatred in his eyes.
‘You keep lying,’ he said. ‘You know perfectly well that 
the best policy for the criminal is to tell the truth as nearly 
as possible … to conceal as little as possible. I don’t believe 
you!’
Crime and Punishment 0‘What a wily person you are!’ Porfiry tittered, ‘there’s no 
catching you; you’ve a perfect monomania. So you don’t be -
lieve me? But still you do believe me, you believe a quarter; 
I’ll soon make you believe the whole, because I have a sin -
cere liking for you and genuinely wish you good.’
Raskolnikov’s lips trembled.
‘Yes, I do,’ went on Porfiry, touching Raskolnikov’s arm 
genially, ‘you must take care of your illness. Besides, your 
mother and sister are here now; you must think of them. 
You must soothe and comfort them and you do nothing but 
frighten them …’
‘What has that to do with you? How do you know it? 
What concern is it of yours? You are keeping watch on me 
and want to let me know it?’
‘Good heavens! Why, I learnt it all from you yourself! 
You don’t notice that in your excitement you tell me and 
others everything. From Razumihin, too, I learnt a num -
ber of interesting details yesterday. No, you interrupted me, 
but I must tell you that, for all your wit, your suspicious -
ness makes you lose the common-sense view of things. To 
return to bell-ringing, for instance. I, an examining lawyer, 
have betrayed a precious thing like that, a real fact (for it is a 
fact worth having), and you see nothing in it! Why, if I had 
the slightest suspicion of you, should I have acted like that? 
No, I should first have disarmed your suspicions and not let 
you see I knew of that fact, should have diverted your atten -
tion and suddenly have dealt you a knock-down blow (your 
expression) saying: ‘And what were you doing, sir, pray, at 
ten or nearly eleven at the murdered woman’s flat and why Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comdid you ring the bell and why did you ask about blood? And 
why did you invite the porters to go with you to the police 
station, to the lieutenant?’ That’s how I ought to have acted 
if I had a grain of suspicion of you. I ought to have taken 
your evidence in due form, searched your lodging and per -
haps have arrested you, too … so I have no suspicion of you, 
since I have not done that! But you can’t look at it normally 
and you see nothing, I say again.’
Raskolnikov started so that Porfiry Petrovitch could not 
fail to perceive it.
‘You are lying all the while,’ he cried, ‘I don’t know your 
object, but you are lying. You did not speak like that just 
now and I cannot be mistaken!’
‘I am lying?’ Porfiry repeated, apparently incensed, but 
preserving a good-humoured and ironical face, as though 
he were not in the least concerned at Raskolnikov’s opinion 
of him. ‘I am lying … but how did I treat you just now, I, 
the examining lawyer? Prompting you and giving you ev -
ery means for your defence; illness, I said, delirium, injury, 
melancholy and the police officers and all the rest of it? Ah! 
He-he-he! Though, indeed, all those psychological means of 
defence are not very reliable and cut both ways: illness, de -
lirium, I don’t remember—that’s all right, but why, my good 
sir, in your illness and in your delirium were you haunted 
by just those delusions and not by any others? There may 
have been others, eh? He-he-he!’
Raskolnikov looked haughtily and contemptuously at 
him.
‘Briefly,’ he said loudly and imperiously, rising to his feet
Crime and Punishment and in so doing pushing Porfiry back a little, ‘briefly, I want 
to know, do you acknowledge me perfectly free from suspi -
cion or not? Tell me, Porfiry Petrovitch, tell me once for all 
and make haste!’
‘What a business I’m having with you!’ cried Porfiry with 
a perfectly good-humoured, sly and composed face. ‘And 
why do you want to know, why do you want to know so 
much, since they haven’t begun to worry you? Why, you are 
like a child asking for matches! And why are you so uneasy? 
Why do you force yourself upon us, eh? He-he-he!’
‘I repeat,’ Raskolnikov cried furiously, ‘that I can’t put up 
with it!’
‘With what? Uncertainty?’ interrupted Porfiry.
‘Don’t jeer at me! I won’t have it! I tell you I won’t have 
it. I can’t and I won’t, do you hear, do you hear?’ he shouted, 
bringing his fist down on the table again.
‘Hush! Hush! They’ll overhear! I warn you seriously, take 
care of yourself. I am not joking,’ Porfiry whispered, but 
this time there was not the look of old womanish good na -
ture and alarm in his face. Now he was peremptory, stern, 
frowning and for once laying aside all mystification.
But this was only for an instant. Raskolnikov, bewil -
dered, suddenly fell into actual frenzy, but, strange to say, 
he again obeyed the command to speak quietly, though he 
was in a perfect paroxysm of fury.
‘I will not allow myself to be tortured,’ he whispered, 
instantly recognising with hatred that he could not help 
obeying the command and driven to even greater fury by 
the thought. ‘Arrest me, search me, but kindly act in due Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comform and don’t play with me! Don’t dare!’
‘Don’t worry about the form,’ Porfiry interrupted with 
the same sly smile, as it were, gloating with enjoyment over 
Raskolnikov. ‘I invited you to see me quite in a friendly 
way.’
‘I don’t want your friendship and I spit on it! Do you 
hear? And, here, I take my cap and go. What will you say 
now if you mean to arrest me?’
He took up his cap and went to the door.
‘And won’t you see my little surprise?’ chuckled Porfiry, 
again taking him by the arm and stopping him at the door.
He seemed to become more playful and good-humoured 
which maddened Raskolnikov.
‘What surprise?’ he asked, standing still and looking at 
Porfiry in alarm.
‘My little surprise, it’s sitting there behind the door, he-
he-he!’ (He pointed to the locked door.) ‘I locked him in 
that he should not escape.’
‘What is it? Where? What? …’
Raskolnikov walked to the door and would have opened 
it, but it was locked.
‘It’s locked, here is the key!’
And he brought a key out of his pocket.
‘You are lying,’ roared Raskolnikov without restraint, 
‘you lie, you damned punchinello!’ and he rushed at Porfiry 
who retreated to the other door, not at all alarmed.
‘I understand it all! You are lying and mocking so that I 
may betray myself to you …’
‘Why, you could not betray yourself any further, my dear
Crime and Punishment Rodion Romanovitch. You are in a passion. Don’t shout, I 
shall call the clerks.’
‘You are lying! Call the clerks! You knew I was ill and 
tried to work me into a frenzy to make me betray myself, 
that was your object! Produce your facts! I understand it all. 
You’ve no evidence, you have only wretched rubbishly sus -
picions like Zametov’s! You knew my character, you wanted 
to drive me to fury and then to knock me down with priests 
and deputies…. Are you waiting for them? eh! What are 
you waiting for? Where are they? Produce them?’
‘Why deputies, my good man? What things people will 
imagine! And to do so would not be acting in form as you 
say, you don’t know the business, my dear fellow…. And 
there’s no escaping form, as you see,’ Porfiry muttered, lis -
tening at the door through which a noise could be heard.
‘Ah, they’re coming,’ cried Raskolnikov. ‘You’ve sent for 
them! You expected them! Well, produce them all: your 
deputies, your witnesses, what you like! … I am ready!’
But at this moment a strange incident occurred, some -
thing so unexpected that neither Raskolnikov nor Porfiry 
Petrovitch could have looked for such a conclusion to their 
interview. Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comChapter VI
When he remembered the scene afterwards, this is how 
Raskolnikov saw it.
The noise behind the door increased, and suddenly the 
door was opened a little.
‘What is it?’ cried Porfiry Petrovitch, annoyed. ‘Why, I 
gave orders …’
For an instant there was no answer, but it was evident 
that there were several persons at the door, and that they 
were apparently pushing somebody back.
‘What is it?’ Porfiry Petrovitch repeated, uneasily.
‘The prisoner Nikolay has been brought,’ someone an -
swered.
‘He is not wanted! Take him away! Let him wait! What’s 
he doing here? How irregular!’ cried Porfiry, rushing to the 
door.
‘But he …’ began the same voice, and suddenly ceased.
Two seconds, not more, were spent in actual struggle, 
then someone gave a violent shove, and then a man, very 
pale, strode into the room.
This man’s appearance was at first sight very strange. He 
stared straight before him, as though seeing nothing. There 
was a determined gleam in his eyes; at the same time there 
was a deathly pallor in his face, as though he were being led 
to the scaffold. His white lips were faintly twitching.
Crime and Punishment He was dressed like a workman and was of medium 
height, very young, slim, his hair cut in round crop, with 
thin spare features. The man whom he had thrust back fol -
lowed him into the room and succeeded in seizing him by 
the shoulder; he was a warder; but Nikolay pulled his arm 
away.
Several persons crowded inquisitively into the doorway. 
Some of them tried to get in. All this took place almost in -
stantaneously.
‘Go away, it’s too soon! Wait till you are sent for! … Why 
have you brought him so soon?’ Porfiry Petrovitch mut -
tered, extremely annoyed, and as it were thrown out of his 
reckoning.
But Nikolay suddenly knelt down.
‘What’s the matter?’ cried Porfiry, surprised.
‘I am guilty! Mine is the sin! I am the murderer,’ Nikolay 
articulated suddenly, rather breathless, but speaking fairly 
loudly.
For ten seconds there was silence as though all had been 
struck dumb; even the warder stepped back, mechanically 
retreated to the door, and stood immovable.
‘What is it?’ cried Porfiry Petrovitch, recovering from his 
momentary stupefaction.
‘I … am the murderer,’ repeated Nikolay, after a brief 
pause.
‘What … you … what … whom did you kill?’ Porfiry 
Petrovitch was obviously bewildered.
Nikolay again was silent for a moment.
‘Alyona Ivanovna and her sister Lizaveta Ivanovna, I … Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comkilled … with an axe. Darkness came over me,’ he added 
suddenly, and was again silent.
He still remained on his knees. Porfiry Petrovitch stood 
for some moments as though meditating, but suddenly 
roused himself and waved back the uninvited spectators. 
They instantly vanished and closed the door. Then he looked 
towards Raskolnikov, who was standing in the corner, star -
ing wildly at Nikolay and moved towards him, but stopped 
short, looked from Nikolay to Raskolnikov and then again 
at Nikolay, and seeming unable to restrain himself darted 
at the latter.
‘You’re in too great a hurry,’ he shouted at him, almost 
angrily. ‘I didn’t ask you what came over you…. Speak, did 
you kill them?’
‘I am the murderer…. I want to give evidence,’ Nikolay 
pronounced.
‘Ach! What did you kill them with?’
‘An axe. I had it ready.’
‘Ach, he is in a hurry! Alone?’
Nikolay did not understand the question.
‘Did you do it alone?’
‘Yes, alone. And Mitka is not guilty and had no share in 
it.’
‘Don’t be in a hurry about Mitka! A-ach! How was it you 
ran downstairs like that at the time? The porters met you 
both!’
‘It was to put them off the scent … I ran after Mitka,’ 
Nikolay replied hurriedly, as though he had prepared the 
answer.
Crime and Punishment ‘I knew it!’ cried Porfiry, with vexation. ‘It’s not his own 
tale he is telling,’ he muttered as though to himself, and 
suddenly his eyes rested on Raskolnikov again.
He was apparently so taken up with Nikolay that for a 
moment he had forgotten Raskolnikov. He was a little taken 
aback.
‘My dear Rodion Romanovitch, excuse me!’ he flew up to 
him, ‘this won’t do; I’m afraid you must go … it’s no good 
your staying … I will … you see, what a surprise! … Good-
bye!’
And taking him by the arm, he showed him to the door.
‘I suppose you didn’t expect it?’ said Raskolnikov who, 
though he had not yet fully grasped the situation, had re -
gained his courage.
‘You did not expect it either, my friend. See how your 
hand is trembling! He-he!’
‘You’re trembling, too, Porfiry Petrovitch!’
‘Yes, I am; I didn’t expect it.’
They were already at the door; Porfiry was impatient for 
Raskolnikov to be gone.
‘And your little surprise, aren’t you going to show it to 
me?’ Raskolnikov said, sarcastically.
‘Why, his teeth are chattering as he asks, he-he! You are 
an ironical person! Come, till we meet!’
‘I believe we can say good-bye !’
‘That’s in God’s hands,’ muttered Porfiry, with an unnat -
ural smile.
As he walked through the office, Raskolnikov noticed 
that many people were looking at him. Among them he saw Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comthe two porters from the house, whom he had invited that 
night to the police station. They stood there waiting. But 
he was no sooner on the stairs than he heard the voice of 
Porfiry Petrovitch behind him. Turning round, he saw the 
latter running after him, out of breath.
‘One word, Rodion Romanovitch; as to all the rest, it’s in 
God’s hands, but as a matter of form there are some ques -
tions I shall have to ask you … so we shall meet again, shan’t 
we?’
And Porfiry stood still, facing him with a smile.
‘Shan’t we?’ he added again.
He seemed to want to say something more, but could not 
speak out.
‘You must forgive me, Porfiry Petrovitch, for what has 
just passed … I lost my temper,’ began Raskolnikov, who 
had so far regained his courage that he felt irresistibly in -
clined to display his coolness.
‘Don’t mention it, don’t mention it,’ Porfiry replied, al -
most gleefully. ‘I myself, too … I have a wicked temper, I 
admit it! But we shall meet again. If it’s God’s will, we may 
see a great deal of one another.’
‘And will get to know each other through and through?’ 
added Raskolnikov.
‘Yes; know each other through and through,’ assented 
Porfiry Petrovitch, and he screwed up his eyes, looking 
earnestly at Raskolnikov. ‘Now you’re going to a birthday 
party?’
‘To a funeral.’
‘Of course, the funeral! Take care of yourself, and get
Crime and Punishment 00well.’
‘I don’t know what to wish you,’ said Raskolnikov, who 
had begun to descend the stairs, but looked back again. ‘I 
should like to wish you success, but your office is such a 
comical one.’
‘Why comical?’ Porfiry Petrovitch had turned to go, but 
he seemed to prick up his ears at this.
‘Why, how you must have been torturing and harassing 
that poor Nikolay psychologically, after your fashion, till he 
confessed! You must have been at him day and night, prov -
ing to him that he was the murderer, and now that he has 
confessed, you’ll begin vivisecting him again. ‘You are ly -
ing,’ you’ll say. ‘You are not the murderer! You can’t be! It’s 
not your own tale you are telling!’ You must admit it’s a 
comical business!’
‘He-he-he! You noticed then that I said to Nikolay just 
now that it was not his own tale he was telling?’
‘How could I help noticing it!’
‘He-he! You are quick-witted. You notice everything! 
You’ve really a playful mind! And you always fasten on the 
comic side … he-he! They say that was the marked charac -
teristic of Gogol, among the writers.’
‘Yes, of Gogol.’
‘Yes, of Gogol…. I shall look forward to meeting you.’
‘So shall I.’
Raskolnikov walked straight home. He was so muddled 
and bewildered that on getting home he sat for a quarter of 
an hour on the sofa, trying to collect his thoughts. He did 
not attempt to think about Nikolay; he was stupefied; he
01 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comfelt that his confession was something inexplicable, amaz -
ing—something beyond his understanding. But Nikolay’s 
confession was an actual fact. The consequences of this fact 
were clear to him at once, its falsehood could not fail to be 
discovered, and then they would be after him again. Till 
then, at least, he was free and must do something for him -
self, for the danger was imminent.
But how imminent? His position gradually became clear 
to him. Remembering, sketchily, the main outlines of his 
recent scene with Porfiry, he could not help shuddering 
again with horror. Of course, he did not yet know all Por -
firy’s aims, he could not see into all his calculations. But he 
had already partly shown his hand, and no one knew bet -
ter than Raskolnikov how terrible Porfiry’s ‘lead’ had been 
for him. A little more and he might  have given himself away 
completely, circumstantially. Knowing his nervous temper -
ament and from the first glance seeing through him, Porfiry, 
though playing a bold game, was bound to win. There’s 
no denying that Raskolnikov had compromised himself 
seriously, but no facts  had come to light as yet; there was 
nothing positive. But was he taking a true view of the po -
sition? Wasn’t he mistaken? What had Porfiry been trying 
to get at? Had he really some surprise prepared for him? 
And what was it? Had he really been expecting something 
or not? How would they have parted if it had not been for 
the unexpected appearance of Nikolay?
Porfiry had shown almost all his cards—of course, he 
had risked something in showing them—and if he had re -
ally had anything up his sleeve (Raskolnikov reflected), he
Crime and Punishment 0would have shown that, too. What was that ‘surprise’? Was 
it a joke? Had it meant anything? Could it have concealed 
anything like a fact, a piece of positive evidence? His yes -
terday’s visitor? What had become of him? Where was he 
to-day? If Porfiry really had any evidence, it must be con -
nected with him….
He sat on the sofa with his elbows on his knees and his 
face hidden in his hands. He was still shivering nervously. 
At last he got up, took his cap, thought a minute, and went 
to the door.
He had a sort of presentiment that for to-day, at least, 
he might consider himself out of danger. He had a sudden 
sense almost of joy; he wanted to make haste to Katerina 
Ivanovna’s. He would be too late for the funeral, of course, 
but he would be in time for the memorial dinner, and there 
at once he would see Sonia.
He stood still, thought a moment, and a suffering smile 
came for a moment on to his lips.
‘To-day! To-day,’ he repeated to himself. ‘Yes, to-day! So 
it must be….’
But as he was about to open the door, it began opening of 
itself. He started and moved back. The door opened gently 
and slowly, and there suddenly appeared a figure—yester -
day’s visitor from underground .
The man stood in the doorway, looked at Raskolnikov 
without speaking, and took a step forward into the room. 
He was exactly the same as yesterday; the same figure, the 
same dress, but there was a great change in his face; he 
looked dejected and sighed deeply. If he had only put his
0 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comhand up to his cheek and leaned his head on one side he 
would have looked exactly like a peasant woman.
‘What do you want?’ asked Raskolnikov, numb with ter -
ror. The man was still silent, but suddenly he bowed down 
almost to the ground, touching it with his finger.
‘What is it?’ cried Raskolnikov.
‘I have sinned,’ the man articulated softly.
‘How?’
‘By evil thoughts.’
They looked at one another.
‘I was vexed. When you came, perhaps in drink, and 
bade the porters go to the police station and asked about 
the blood, I was vexed that they let you go and took you for 
drunken. I was so vexed that I lost my sleep. And remem -
bering the address we came here yesterday and asked for 
you….’
‘Who came?’ Raskolnikov interrupted, instantly begin -
ning to recollect.
‘I did, I’ve wronged you.’
‘Then you come from that house?’
‘I was standing at the gate with them … don’t you re -
member? We have carried on our trade in that house for 
years past. We cure and prepare hides, we take work home 
… most of all I was vexed….’
And the whole scene of the day before yesterday in the 
gateway came clearly before Raskolnikov’s mind; he recol -
lected that there had been several people there besides the 
porters, women among them. He remembered one voice 
had suggested taking him straight to the police- station. He
Crime and Punishment 0could not recall the face of the speaker, and even now he 
did not recognise it, but he remembered that he had turned 
round and made him some answer….
So this was the solution of yesterday’s horror. The most 
awful thought was that he had been actually almost lost, 
had almost done for himself on account of such a trivial  cir-
cumstance. So this man could tell nothing except his asking 
about the flat and the blood stains. So Porfiry, too, had noth -
ing but that delirium  no facts but this psychology  which cuts 
both ways  nothing positive. So if no more facts come to light 
(and they must not, they must not!) then … then what can 
they do to him? How can they convict him, even if they ar -
rest him? And Porfiry then had only just heard about the 
flat and had not known about it before.
‘Was it you who told Porfiry … that I’d been there?’ he 
cried, struck by a sudden idea.
‘What Porfiry?’
‘The head of the detective department?’
‘Yes. The porters did not go there, but I went.’
‘To-day?’
‘I got there two minutes before you. And I heard, I heard 
it all, how he worried you.’
‘Where? What? When?’
‘Why, in the next room. I was sitting there all the time.’
‘What? Why, then you were the surprise? But how could 
it happen? Upon my word!’
‘I saw that the porters did not want to do what I said,’ be -
gan the man; ‘for it’s too late, said they, and maybe he’ll be 
angry that we did not come at the time. I was vexed and I
0 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comlost my sleep, and I began making inquiries. And finding 
out yesterday where to go, I went to-day. The first time I 
went he wasn’t there, when I came an hour later he couldn’t 
see me. I went the third time, and they showed me in. I 
informed him of everything, just as it happened, and he be -
gan skipping about the room and punching himself on the 
chest. ‘What do you scoundrels mean by it? If I’d known 
about it I should have arrested him!’ Then he ran out, called 
somebody and began talking to him in the corner, then he 
turned to me, scolding and questioning me. He scolded me 
a great deal; and I told him everything, and I told him that 
you didn’t dare to say a word in answer to me yesterday and 
that you didn’t recognise me. And he fell to running about 
again and kept hitting himself on the chest, and getting an -
gry and running about, and when you were announced he 
told me to go into the next room. ‘Sit there a bit,’ he said. 
‘Don’t move, whatever you may hear.’ And he set a chair 
there for me and locked me in. ‘Perhaps,’ he said, ‘I may call 
you.’ And when Nikolay’d been brought he let me out as 
soon as you were gone. ‘I shall send for you again and ques -
tion you,’ he said.’
‘And did he question Nikolay while you were there?’
‘He got rid of me as he did of you, before he spoke to 
Nikolay.’
The man stood still, and again suddenly bowed down, 
touching the ground with his finger.
‘Forgive me for my evil thoughts, and my slander.’
‘May God forgive you,’ answered Raskolnikov.
And as he said this, the man bowed down again, but not
Crime and Punishment 0to the ground, turned slowly and went out of the room.
‘It all cuts both ways, now it all cuts both ways,’ repeated 
Raskolnikov, and he went out more confident than ever.
‘Now we’ll make a fight for it,’ he said, with a malicious 
smile, as he went down the stairs. His malice was aimed at 
himself; with shame and contempt he recollected his ‘cow -
ardice.’

## Chapter 5

The morning that followed the fateful interview with 
Dounia and her mother brought sobering influenc -
es to bear on Pyotr Petrovitch. Intensely unpleasant as it 
was, he was forced little by little to accept as a fact beyond 
recall what had seemed to him only the day before fan -
tastic and incredible. The black snake of wounded vanity 
had been gnawing at his heart all night. When he got out 
of bed, Pyotr Petrovitch immediately looked in the look -
ing-glass. He was afraid that he had jaundice. However his 
health seemed unimpaired so far, and looking at his noble, 
clear-skinned countenance which had grown fattish of late, 
Pyotr Petrovitch for an instant was positively comforted in 
the conviction that he would find another bride and, per -
haps, even a better one. But coming back to the sense of 
his present position, he turned aside and spat vigorously, 
which excited a sarcastic smile in Andrey Semyonovitch 
Lebeziatnikov, the young friend with whom he was stay -
ing. That smile Pyotr Petrovitch noticed, and at once set it 
down against his young friend’s account. He had set down 
a good many points against him of late. His anger was re -
doubled when he reflected that he ought not to have told 
Andrey Semyonovitch about the result of yesterday’s inter -
view. That was the second mistake he had made in temper, 
through impulsiveness and irritability…. Moreover, all that
0 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.commorning one unpleasantness followed another. He even 
found a hitch awaiting him in his legal case in the senate. 
He was particularly irritated by the owner of the flat which 
had been taken in view of his approaching marriage and 
was being redecorated at his own expense; the owner, a rich 
German tradesman, would not entertain the idea of break -
ing the contract which had just been signed and insisted 
on the full forfeit money, though Pyotr Petrovitch would 
be giving him back the flat practically redecorated. In the 
same way the upholsterers refused to return a single rouble 
of the instalment paid for the furniture purchased but not 
yet removed to the flat.
‘Am I to get married simply for the sake of the furniture?’ 
Pyotr Petrovitch ground his teeth and at the same time once 
more he had a gleam of desperate hope. ‘Can all that be re -
ally so irrevocably over? Is it no use to make another effort?’ 
The thought of Dounia sent a voluptuous pang through his 
heart. He endured anguish at that moment, and if it had 
been possible to slay Raskolnikov instantly by wishing it, 
Pyotr Petrovitch would promptly have uttered the wish.
‘It was my mistake, too, not to have given them money,’ 
he thought, as he returned dejectedly to Lebeziatnikov’s 
room, ‘and why on earth was I such a Jew? It was false econ -
omy! I meant to keep them without a penny so that they 
should turn to me as their providence, and look at them! 
foo! If I’d spent some fifteen hundred roubles on them for 
the trousseau and presents, on knick-knacks, dressing-cases, 
jewellery, materials, and all that sort of trash from Knopp’s 
and the English shop, my position would have been better
Crime and Punishment 10and … stronger! They could not have refused me so easily! 
They are the sort of people that would feel bound to return 
money and presents if they broke it off; and they would find 
it hard to do it! And their conscience would prick them: 
how can we dismiss a man who has hitherto been so gener -
ous and delicate?…. H’m! I’ve made a blunder.’
And grinding his teeth again, Pyotr Petrovitch called 
himself a fool— but not aloud, of course.
He returned home, twice as irritated and angry as before. 
The preparations for the funeral dinner at Katerina Ivanov -
na’s excited his curiosity as he passed. He had heard about it 
the day before; he fancied, indeed, that he had been invited, 
but absorbed in his own cares he had paid no attention. In -
quiring of Madame Lippevechsel who was busy laying the 
table while Katerina Ivanovna was away at the cemetery, he 
heard that the entertainment was to be a great affair, that all 
the lodgers had been invited, among them some who had 
not known the dead man, that even Andrey Semyonovitch 
Lebeziatnikov was invited in spite of his previous quarrel 
with Katerina Ivanovna, that he, Pyotr Petrovitch, was not 
only invited, but was eagerly expected as he was the most 
important of the lodgers. Amalia Ivanovna herself had been 
invited with great ceremony in spite of the recent unpleas -
antness, and so she was very busy with preparations and 
was taking a positive pleasure in them; she was moreover 
dressed up to the nines, all in new black silk, and she was 
proud of it. All this suggested an idea to Pyotr Petrovitch 
and he went into his room, or rather Lebeziatnikov’s, some -
what thoughtful. He had learnt that Raskolnikov was to be
11 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comone of the guests.
Andrey Semyonovitch had been at home all the morn -
ing. The attitude of Pyotr Petrovitch to this gentleman was 
strange, though perhaps natural. Pyotr Petrovitch had de -
spised and hated him from the day he came to stay with him 
and at the same time he seemed somewhat afraid of him. He 
had not come to stay with him on his arrival in Petersburg 
simply from parsimony, though that had been perhaps his 
chief object. He had heard of Andrey Semyonovitch, who 
had once been his ward, as a leading young progressive who 
was taking an important part in certain interesting circles, 
the doings of which were a legend in the provinces. It had 
impressed Pyotr Petrovitch. These powerful omniscient cir -
cles who despised everyone and showed everyone up had 
long inspired in him a peculiar but quite vague alarm. He 
had not, of course, been able to form even an approximate 
notion of what they meant. He, like everyone, had heard 
that there were, especially in Petersburg, progressives of 
some sort, nihilists and so on, and, like many people, he ex -
aggerated and distorted the significance of those words to 
an absurd degree. What for many years past he had feared 
more than anything was being shown up  and this was the 
chief ground for his continual uneasiness at the thought of 
transferring his business to Petersburg. He was afraid of 
this as little children are sometimes panic-stricken. Some 
years before, when he was just entering on his own career, 
he had come upon two cases in which rather important 
personages in the province, patrons of his, had been cruelly 
shown up. One instance had ended in great scandal for the
Crime and Punishment 1person attacked and the other had very nearly ended in se -
rious trouble. For this reason Pyotr Petrovitch intended to 
go into the subject as soon as he reached Petersburg and, if 
necessary, to anticipate contingencies by seeking the favour 
of ‘our younger generation.’ He relied on Andrey Semyo -
novitch for this and before his visit to Raskolnikov he had 
succeeded in picking up some current phrases. He soon 
discovered that Andrey Semyonovitch was a commonplace 
simpleton, but that by no means reassured Pyotr Petrovitch. 
Even if he had been certain that all the progressives were 
fools like him, it would not have allayed his uneasiness. All 
the doctrines, the ideas, the systems, with which Andrey 
Semyonovitch pestered him had no interest for him. He had 
his own object—he simply wanted to find out at once what 
was happening here. Had these people any power or not? 
Had he anything to fear from them? Would they expose any 
enterprise of his? And what precisely was now the object of 
their attacks? Could he somehow make up to them and get 
round them if they really were powerful? Was this the thing 
to do or not? Couldn’t he gain something through them? In 
fact hundreds of questions presented themselves.
Andrey Semyonovitch was an anæmic, scrofulous little 
man, with strangely flaxen mutton-chop whiskers of which 
he was very proud. He was a clerk and had almost always 
something wrong with his eyes. He was rather soft-heart -
ed, but self-confident and sometimes extremely conceited 
in speech, which had an absurd effect, incongruous with 
his little figure. He was one of the lodgers most respected 
by Amalia Ivanovna, for he did not get drunk and paid reg -
1 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comularly for his lodgings. Andrey Semyonovitch really was 
rather stupid; he attached himself to the cause of progress 
and ‘our younger generation’ from enthusiasm. He was one 
of the numerous and varied legion of dullards, of half-an -
imate abortions, conceited, half-educated coxcombs, who 
attach themselves to the idea most in fashion only to vul -
garise it and who caricature every cause they serve, however 
sincerely.
Though Lebeziatnikov was so good-natured, he, too, was 
beginning to dislike Pyotr Petrovitch. This happened on 
both sides unconsciously. However simple Andrey Semyo -
novitch might be, he began to see that Pyotr Petrovitch was 
duping him and secretly despising him, and that ‘he was 
not the right sort of man.’ He had tried expounding to him 
the system of Fourier and the Darwinian theory, but of late 
Pyotr Petrovitch began to listen too sarcastically and even 
to be rude. The fact was he had begun instinctively to guess 
that Lebeziatnikov was not merely a commonplace simple -
ton, but, perhaps, a liar, too, and that he had no connections 
of any consequence even in his own circle, but had simply 
picked things up third-hand; and that very likely he did 
not even know much about his own work of propaganda, 
for he was in too great a muddle. A fine person he would 
be to show anyone up! It must be noted, by the way, that 
Pyotr Petrovitch had during those ten days eagerly accept -
ed the strangest praise from Andrey Semyonovitch; he had 
not protested, for instance, when Andrey Semyonovitch 
belauded him for being ready to contribute to the establish -
ment of the new ‘commune,’ or to abstain from christening
Crime and Punishment 1his future children, or to acquiesce if Dounia were to take 
a lover a month after marriage, and so on. Pyotr Petrovitch 
so enjoyed hearing his own praises that he did not disdain 
even such virtues when they were attributed to him.
Pyotr Petrovitch had had occasion that morning to re -
alise some five- per-cent bonds and now he sat down to the 
table and counted over bundles of notes. Andrey Semyo -
novitch who hardly ever had any money walked about the 
room pretending to himself to look at all those bank notes 
with indifference and even contempt. Nothing would have 
convinced Pyotr Petrovitch that Andrey Semyonovitch 
could really look on the money unmoved, and the latter, on 
his side, kept thinking bitterly that Pyotr Petrovitch was 
capable of entertaining such an idea about him and was, 
perhaps, glad of the opportunity of teasing his young friend 
by reminding him of his inferiority and the great difference 
between them.
He found him incredibly inattentive and irritable, though 
he, Andrey Semyonovitch, began enlarging on his favourite 
subject, the foundation of a new special ‘commune.’ The 
brief remarks that dropped from Pyotr Petrovitch between 
the clicking of the beads on the reckoning frame betrayed 
unmistakable and discourteous irony. But the ‘humane’ 
Andrey Semyonovitch ascribed Pyotr Petrovitch’s ill-hu -
mour to his recent breach with Dounia and he was burning 
with impatience to discourse on that theme. He had some -
thing progressive to say on the subject which might console 
his worthy friend and ‘could not fail’ to promote his devel -
opment.
1 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com‘There is some sort of festivity being prepared at that … 
at the widow’s, isn’t there?’ Pyotr Petrovitch asked suddenly, 
interrupting Andrey Semyonovitch at the most interesting 
passage.
‘Why, don’t you know? Why, I was telling you last night 
what I think about all such ceremonies. And she invited you 
too, I heard. You were talking to her yesterday …’
‘I should never have expected that beggarly fool would 
have spent on this feast all the money she got from that 
other fool, Raskolnikov. I was surprised just now as I came 
through at the preparations there, the wines! Several people 
are invited. It’s beyond everything!’ continued Pyotr Petro -
vitch, who seemed to have some object in pursuing the 
conversation. ‘What? You say I am asked too? When was 
that? I don’t remember. But I shan’t go. Why should I? I only 
said a word to her in passing yesterday of the possibility of 
her obtaining a year’s salary as a destitute widow of a gov -
ernment clerk. I suppose she has invited me on that account, 
hasn’t she? He-he-he!’
‘I don’t intend to go either,’ said Lebeziatnikov.
‘I should think not, after giving her a thrashing! You 
might well hesitate, he-he!’
‘Who thrashed? Whom?’ cried Lebeziatnikov, flustered 
and blushing.
‘Why, you thrashed Katerina Ivanovna a month ago. 
I heard so yesterday … so that’s what your convictions 
amount to … and the woman question, too, wasn’t quite 
sound, he-he-he!’ and Pyotr Petrovitch, as though comfort -
ed, went back to clicking his beads.
Crime and Punishment 1‘It’s all slander and nonsense!’ cried Lebeziatnikov, who 
was always afraid of allusions to the subject. ‘It was not like 
that at all, it was quite different. You’ve heard it wrong; it’s a 
libel. I was simply defending myself. She rushed at me first 
with her nails, she pulled out all my whiskers…. It’s per -
missable for anyone, I should hope, to defend himself and 
I never allow anyone to use violence to me on principle, for 
it’s an act of despotism. What was I to do? I simply pushed 
her back.’
‘He-he-he!’ Luzhin went on laughing maliciously.
‘You keep on like that because you are out of humour 
yourself…. But that’s nonsense and it has nothing, nothing 
whatever to do with the woman question! You don’t under -
stand; I used to think, indeed, that if women are equal to 
men in all respects, even in strength (as is maintained now) 
there ought to be equality in that, too. Of course, I reflect -
ed afterwards that such a question ought not really to arise, 
for there ought not to be fighting and in the future soci -
ety fighting is unthinkable … and that it would be a queer 
thing to seek for equality in fighting. I am not so stupid … 
though, of course, there is fighting … there won’t be later, 
but at present there is … confound it! How muddled one 
gets with you! It’s not on that account that I am not going. 
I am not going on principle, not to take part in the revolt -
ing convention of memorial dinners, that’s why! Though, of 
course, one might go to laugh at it…. I am sorry there won’t 
be any priests at it. I should certainly go if there were.’
‘Then you would sit down at another man’s table and in -
sult it and those who invited you. Eh?’
1 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com‘Certainly not insult, but protest. I should do it with a 
good object. I might indirectly assist the cause of enlight -
enment and propaganda. It’s a duty of every man to work 
for enlightenment and propaganda and the more harshly, 
perhaps, the better. I might drop a seed, an idea…. And 
something might grow up from that seed. How should 
I be insulting them? They might be offended at first, but 
afterwards they’d see I’d done them a service. You know, 
Terebyeva (who is in the community now) was blamed be -
cause when she left her family and … devoted … herself, 
she wrote to her father and mother that she wouldn’t go on 
living conventionally and was entering on a free marriage 
and it was said that that was too harsh, that she might have 
spared them and have written more kindly. I think that’s 
all nonsense and there’s no need of softness; on the con -
trary, what’s wanted is protest. Varents had been married 
seven years, she abandoned her two children, she told her 
husband straight out in a letter: ‘I have realised that I can -
not be happy with you. I can never forgive you that you 
have deceived me by concealing from me that there is an -
other organisation of society by means of the communities. 
I have only lately learned it from a great-hearted man to 
whom I have given myself and with whom I am establishing 
a community. I speak plainly because I consider it dishon -
est to deceive you. Do as you think best. Do not hope to get 
me back, you are too late. I hope you will be happy.’ That’s 
how letters like that ought to be written!’
‘Is that Terebyeva the one you said had made a third free 
marriage?’
Crime and Punishment 1‘No, it’s only the second, really! But what if it were the 
fourth, what if it were the fifteenth, that’s all nonsense! 
And if ever I regretted the death of my father and mother, 
it is now, and I sometimes think if my parents were living 
what a protest I would have aimed at them! I would have 
done something on purpose … I would have shown them! 
I would have astonished them! I am really sorry there is no 
one!’
‘To surprise! He-he! Well, be that as you will,’ Pyotr 
Petrovitch interrupted, ‘but tell me this; do you know the 
dead man’s daughter, the delicate-looking little thing? It’s 
true what they say about her, isn’t it?’
‘What of it? I think, that is, it is my own personal convic -
tion that this is the normal condition of women. Why not? I 
mean, distinguons . In our present society it is not altogether 
normal, because it is compulsory, but in the future society it 
will be perfectly normal, because it will be voluntary. Even 
as it is, she was quite right: she was suffering and that was 
her asset, so to speak, her capital which she had a perfect 
right to dispose of. Of course, in the future society there 
will be no need of assets, but her part will have another sig -
nificance, rational and in harmony with her environment. 
As to Sofya Semyonovna personally, I regard her action as 
a vigorous protest against the organisation of society, and 
I respect her deeply for it; I rejoice indeed when I look at 
her!’
‘I was told that you got her turned out of these lodgings.’
Lebeziatnikov was enraged.
‘That’s another slander,’ he yelled. ‘It was not so at all!
1 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comThat was all Katerina Ivanovna’s invention, for she did not 
understand! And I never made love to Sofya Semyonovna! 
I was simply developing her, entirely disinterestedly, trying 
to rouse her to protest…. All I wanted was her protest and 
Sofya Semyonovna could not have remained here anyway!’
‘Have you asked her to join your community?’
‘You keep on laughing and very inappropriately, allow me 
to tell you. You don’t understand! There is no such rôle in a 
community. The community is established that there should 
be no such rôles. In a community, such a rôle is essentially 
transformed and what is stupid here is sensible there, what, 
under present conditions, is unnatural becomes perfectly 
natural in the community. It all depends on the environ -
ment. It’s all the environment and man himself is nothing. 
And I am on good terms with Sofya Semyonovna to this 
day, which is a proof that she never regarded me as having 
wronged her. I am trying now to attract her to the commu -
nity, but on quite, quite a different footing. What are you 
laughing at? We are trying to establish a community of our 
own, a special one, on a broader basis. We have gone fur -
ther in our convictions. We reject more! And meanwhile 
I’m still developing Sofya Semyonovna. She has a beautiful, 
beautiful character!’
‘And you take advantage of her fine character, eh? He-
he!’
‘No, no! Oh, no! On the contrary.’
‘Oh, on the contrary! He-he-he! A queer thing to say!’
‘Believe me! Why should I disguise it? In fact, I feel it 
strange myself how timid, chaste and modern she is with
Crime and Punishment 0me!’
‘And you, of course, are developing her … he-he! trying 
to prove to her that all that modesty is nonsense?’
‘Not at all, not at all! How coarsely, how stupidly—excuse 
me saying so—you misunderstand the word development! 
Good heavens, how … crude you still are! We are striving 
for the freedom of women and you have only one idea in 
your head…. Setting aside the general question of chastity 
and feminine modesty as useless in themselves and indeed 
prejudices, I fully accept her chastity with me, because 
that’s for her to decide. Of course if she were to tell me her -
self that she wanted me, I should think myself very lucky, 
because I like the girl very much; but as it is, no one has ever 
treated her more courteously than I, with more respect for 
her dignity … I wait in hopes, that’s all!’
‘You had much better make her a present of something. I 
bet you never thought of that.’
‘You don’t understand, as I’ve told you already! Of course, 
she is in such a position, but it’s another question. Quite an -
other question! You simply despise her. Seeing a fact which 
you mistakenly consider deserving of contempt, you re -
fuse to take a humane view of a fellow creature. You don’t 
know what a character she is! I am only sorry that of late 
she has quite given up reading and borrowing books. I used 
to lend them to her. I am sorry, too, that with all the en -
ergy and resolution in protesting—which she has already 
shown once—she has little self-reliance, little, so to say, in -
dependence, so as to break free from certain prejudices and 
certain foolish ideas. Yet she thoroughly understands some Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comquestions, for instance about kissing of hands, that is, that 
it’s an insult to a woman for a man to kiss her hand, be -
cause it’s a sign of inequality. We had a debate about it and 
I described it to her. She listened attentively to an account 
of the workmen’s associations in France, too. Now I am ex -
plaining the question of coming into the room in the future 
society.’
‘And what’s that, pray?’
‘We had a debate lately on the question: Has a member of 
the community the right to enter another member’s room, 
whether man or woman, at any time … and we decided that 
he has!’
‘It might be at an inconvenient moment, he-he!’
Lebeziatnikov was really angry.
‘You are always thinking of something unpleasant,’ he 
cried with aversion. ‘Tfoo! How vexed I am that when I was 
expounding our system, I referred prematurely to the ques -
tion of personal privacy! It’s always a stumbling-block to 
people like you, they turn it into ridicule before they under -
stand it. And how proud they are of it, too! Tfoo! I’ve often 
maintained that that question should not be approached by 
a novice till he has a firm faith in the system. And tell me, 
please, what do you find so shameful even in cesspools? I 
should be the first to be ready to clean out any cesspool you 
like. And it’s not a question of self-sacrifice, it’s simply work, 
honourable, useful work which is as good as any other and 
much better than the work of a Raphael and a Pushkin, be -
cause it is more useful.’
‘And more honourable, more honourable, he-he-he!’
Crime and Punishment ‘What do you mean by ‘more honourable’? I don’t under -
stand such expressions to describe human activity. ‘More 
honourable,’ ‘nobler’— all those are old-fashioned prejudic -
es which I reject. Everything which is of use  to mankind is 
honourable. I only understand one word: useful ! You can 
snigger as much as you like, but that’s so!’
Pyotr Petrovitch laughed heartily. He had finished 
counting the money and was putting it away. But some of 
the notes he left on the table. The ‘cesspool question’ had 
already been a subject of dispute between them. What was 
absurd was that it made Lebeziatnikov really angry, while it 
amused Luzhin and at that moment he particularly wanted 
to anger his young friend.
‘It’s your ill-luck yesterday that makes you so ill-hu -
moured and annoying,’ blurted out Lebeziatnikov, who in 
spite of his ‘independence’ and his ‘protests’ did not venture 
to oppose Pyotr Petrovitch and still behaved to him with 
some of the respect habitual in earlier years.
‘You’d better tell me this,’ Pyotr Petrovitch interrupted 
with haughty displeasure, ‘can you … or rather are you re -
ally friendly enough with that young person to ask her to 
step in here for a minute? I think they’ve all come back from 
the cemetery … I heard the sound of steps … I want to see 
her, that young person.’
‘What for?’ Lebeziatnikov asked with surprise.
‘Oh, I want to. I am leaving here to-day or to-morrow 
and therefore I wanted to speak to her about … However, 
you may be present during the interview. It’s better you 
should be, indeed. For there’s no knowing what you might Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comimagine.’
‘I shan’t imagine anything. I only asked and, if you’ve 
anything to say to her, nothing is easier than to call her in. 
I’ll go directly and you may be sure I won’t be in your way.’
Five minutes later Lebeziatnikov came in with Sonia. 
She came in very much surprised and overcome with shy -
ness as usual. She was always shy in such circumstances and 
was always afraid of new people, she had been as a child 
and was even more so now…. Pyotr Petrovitch met her 
‘politely and affably,’ but with a certain shade of bantering 
familiarity which in his opinion was suitable for a man of 
his respectability and weight in dealing with a creature so 
young and so interesting  as she. He hastened to ‘reassure’ 
her and made her sit down facing him at the table. Sonia 
sat down, looked about her—at Lebeziatnikov, at the notes 
lying on the table and then again at Pyotr Petrovitch and 
her eyes remained riveted on him. Lebeziatnikov was mov -
ing to the door. Pyotr Petrovitch signed to Sonia to remain 
seated and stopped Lebeziatnikov.
‘Is Raskolnikov in there? Has he come?’ he asked him in 
a whisper.
‘Raskolnikov? Yes. Why? Yes, he is there. I saw him just 
come in…. Why?’
‘Well, I particularly beg you to remain here with us and 
not to leave me alone with this … young woman. I only want 
a few words with her, but God knows what they may make 
of it. I shouldn’t like Raskolnikov to repeat anything…. You 
understand what I mean?’
‘I understand!’ Lebeziatnikov saw the point. ‘Yes, you are
Crime and Punishment right…. Of course, I am convinced personally that you have 
no reason to be uneasy, but … still, you are right. Certainly 
I’ll stay. I’ll stand here at the window and not be in your way 
… I think you are right …’
Pyotr Petrovitch returned to the sofa, sat down opposite 
Sonia, looked attentively at her and assumed an extremely 
dignified, even severe expression, as much as to say, ‘don’t 
you make any mistake, madam.’ Sonia was overwhelmed 
with embarrassment.
‘In the first place, Sofya Semyonovna, will you make my 
excuses to your respected mamma…. That’s right, isn’t it? 
Katerina Ivanovna stands in the place of a mother to you?’ 
Pyotr Petrovitch began with great dignity, though affably.
It was evident that his intentions were friendly.
‘Quite so, yes; the place of a mother,’ Sonia answered, 
timidly and hurriedly.
‘Then will you make my apologies to her? Through inevi -
table circumstances I am forced to be absent and shall not 
be at the dinner in spite of your mamma’s kind invitation.’
‘Yes … I’ll tell her … at once.’
And Sonia hastily jumped up from her seat.
‘Wait, that’s not all,’ Pyotr Petrovitch detained her, smil -
ing at her simplicity and ignorance of good manners, ‘and 
you know me little, my dear Sofya Semyonovna, if you sup -
pose I would have ventured to trouble a person like you for a 
matter of so little consequence affecting myself only. I have 
another object.’
Sonia sat down hurriedly. Her eyes rested again for an 
instant on the grey-and-rainbow-coloured notes that re - Free eBooks at Planet eBook.commained on the table, but she quickly looked away and fixed 
her eyes on Pyotr Petrovitch. She felt it horribly indecorous, 
especially for her to look at another person’s money. She 
stared at the gold eye-glass which Pyotr Petrovitch held in 
his left hand and at the massive and extremely handsome 
ring with a yellow stone on his middle finger. But suddenly 
she looked away and, not knowing where to turn, ended by 
staring Pyotr Petrovitch again straight in the face. After a 
pause of still greater dignity he continued.
‘I chanced yesterday in passing to exchange a couple 
of words with Katerina Ivanovna, poor woman. That was 
sufficient to enable me to ascertain that she is in a position—
preternatural, if one may so express it.’
‘Yes … preternatural …’ Sonia hurriedly assented.
‘Or it would be simpler and more comprehensible to say, 
ill.’
‘Yes, simpler and more comprehen … yes, ill.’
‘Quite so. So then from a feeling of humanity and so to 
speak compassion, I should be glad to be of service to her in 
any way, foreseeing her unfortunate position. I believe the 
whole of this poverty-stricken family depends now entirely 
on you?’
‘Allow me to ask,’ Sonia rose to her feet, ‘did you say 
something to her yesterday of the possibility of a pension? 
Because she told me you had undertaken to get her one. 
Was that true?’
‘Not in the slightest, and indeed it’s an absurdity! I merely 
hinted at her obtaining temporary assistance as the widow 
of an official who had died in the service—if only she has
Crime and Punishment patronage … but apparently your late parent had not served 
his full term and had not indeed been in the service at all 
of late. In fact, if there could be any hope, it would be very 
ephemeral, because there would be no claim for assistance 
in that case, far from it…. And she is dreaming of a pension 
already, he-he-he! … A go-ahead lady!’
‘Yes, she is. For she is credulous and good-hearted, and 
she believes everything from the goodness of her heart and 
… and … and she is like that … yes … You must excuse her,’ 
said Sonia, and again she got up to go.
‘But you haven’t heard what I have to say.’
‘No, I haven’t heard,’ muttered Sonia.
‘Then sit down.’ She was terribly confused; she sat down 
again a third time.
‘Seeing her position with her unfortunate little ones, I 
should be glad, as I have said before, so far as lies in my 
power, to be of service, that is, so far as is in my power, not 
more. One might for instance get up a subscription for her, 
or a lottery, something of the sort, such as is always ar -
ranged in such cases by friends or even outsiders desirous 
of assisting people. It was of that I intended to speak to you; 
it might be done.’
‘Yes, yes … God will repay you for it,’ faltered Sonia, gaz -
ing intently at Pyotr Petrovitch.
‘It might be, but we will talk of it later. We might be -
gin it to-day, we will talk it over this evening and lay the 
foundation so to speak. Come to me at seven o’clock. Mr. 
Lebeziatnikov, I hope, will assist us. But there is one cir -
cumstance of which I ought to warn you beforehand and for Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comwhich I venture to trouble you, Sofya Semyonovna, to come 
here. In my opinion money cannot be, indeed it’s unsafe 
to put it into Katerina Ivanovna’s own hands. The dinner 
to-day is a proof of that. Though she has not, so to speak, 
a crust of bread for to-morrow and … well, boots or shoes, 
or anything; she has bought to-day Jamaica rum, and even, 
I believe, Madeira and … and coffee. I saw it as I passed 
through. To-morrow it will all fall upon you again, they 
won’t have a crust of bread. It’s absurd, really, and so, to my 
thinking, a subscription ought to be raised so that the un -
happy widow should not know of the money, but only you, 
for instance. Am I right?’
‘I don’t know … this is only to-day, once in her life…. She 
was so anxious to do honour, to celebrate the memory…. 
And she is very sensible … but just as you think and I shall 
be very, very … they will all be … and God will reward … 
and the orphans …’
Sonia burst into tears.
‘Very well, then, keep it in mind; and now will you ac -
cept for the benefit of your relation the small sum that I am 
able to spare, from me personally. I am very anxious that 
my name should not be mentioned in connection with it. 
Here … having so to speak anxieties of my own, I cannot 
do more …’
And Pyotr Petrovitch held out to Sonia a ten-rouble note 
carefully unfolded. Sonia took it, flushed crimson, jumped 
up, muttered something and began taking leave. Pyotr 
Petrovitch accompanied her ceremoniously to the door. 
She got out of the room at last, agitated and distressed, and
Crime and Punishment returned to Katerina Ivanovna, overwhelmed with confu -
sion.
All this time Lebeziatnikov had stood at the window or 
walked about the room, anxious not to interrupt the con -
versation; when Sonia had gone he walked up to Pyotr 
Petrovitch and solemnly held out his hand.
‘I heard and saw everything,’ he said, laying stress on the 
last verb. ‘That is honourable, I mean to say, it’s humane! 
You wanted to avoid gratitude, I saw! And although I can -
not, I confess, in principle sympathise with private charity, 
for it not only fails to eradicate the evil but even promotes it, 
yet I must admit that I saw your action with pleasure—yes, 
yes, I like it.’
‘That’s all nonsense,’ muttered Pyotr Petrovitch, some -
what disconcerted, looking carefully at Lebeziatnikov.
‘No, it’s not nonsense! A man who has suffered dis -
tress and annoyance as you did yesterday and who yet can 
sympathise with the misery of others, such a man … even 
though he is making a social mistake—is still deserving of 
respect! I did not expect it indeed of you, Pyotr Petrovitch, 
especially as according to your ideas … oh, what a drawback 
your ideas are to you! How distressed you are for instance 
by your ill-luck yesterday,’ cried the simple-hearted Lebezi -
atnikov, who felt a return of affection for Pyotr Petrovitch. 
‘And, what do you want with marriage, with legal  marriage, 
my dear, noble Pyotr Petrovitch? Why do you cling to this 
legality  of marriage? Well, you may beat me if you like, but I 
am glad, positively glad it hasn’t come off, that you are free, 
that you are not quite lost for humanity…. you see, I’ve spo - Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comken my mind!’
‘Because I don’t want in your free marriage to be made a 
fool of and to bring up another man’s children, that’s why I 
want legal marriage,’ Luzhin replied in order to make some 
answer.
He seemed preoccupied by something.
‘Children? You referred to children,’ Lebeziatnikov start -
ed off like a warhorse at the trumpet call. ‘Children are a 
social question and a question of first importance, I agree; 
but the question of children has another solution. Some re -
fuse to have children altogether, because they suggest the 
institution of the family. We’ll speak of children later, but 
now as to the question of honour, I confess that’s my weak 
point. That horrid, military, Pushkin expression is un -
thinkable in the dictionary of the future. What does it mean 
indeed? It’s nonsense, there will be no deception in a free 
marriage! That is only the natural consequence of a legal 
marriage, so to say, its corrective, a protest. So that indeed 
it’s not humiliating … and if I ever, to suppose an absurdity, 
were to be legally married, I should be positively glad of it. 
I should say to my wife: ‘My dear, hitherto I have loved you, 
now I respect you, for you’ve shown you can protest!’ You 
laugh! That’s because you are of incapable of getting away 
from prejudices. Confound it all! I understand now where 
the unpleasantness is of being deceived in a legal marriage, 
but it’s simply a despicable consequence of a despicable po -
sition in which both are humiliated. When the deception 
is open, as in a free marriage, then it does not exist, it’s un -
thinkable. Your wife will only prove how she respects you
Crime and Punishment 0by considering you incapable of opposing her happiness 
and avenging yourself on her for her new husband. Damn it 
all! I sometimes dream if I were to be married, pfoo! I mean 
if I were to marry, legally or not, it’s just the same, I should 
present my wife with a lover if she had not found one for 
herself. ‘My dear,’ I should say, ‘I love you, but even more 
than that I desire you to respect me. See!’ Am I not right?’
Pyotr Petrovitch sniggered as he listened, but without 
much merriment. He hardly heard it indeed. He was pre -
occupied with something else and even Lebeziatnikov at 
last noticed it. Pyotr Petrovitch seemed excited and rubbed 
his hands. Lebeziatnikov remembered all this and reflected 
upon it afterwards. Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comChapter II
It would be difficult to explain exactly what could have 
originated the idea of that senseless dinner in Katerina 
Ivanovna’s disordered brain. Nearly ten of the twenty rou -
bles, given by Raskolnikov for Marmeladov’s funeral, were 
wasted upon it. Possibly Katerina Ivanovna felt obliged to 
honour the memory of the deceased ‘suitably,’ that all the 
lodgers, and still more Amalia Ivanovna, might know ‘that 
he was in no way their inferior, and perhaps very much their 
superior,’ and that no one had the right ‘to turn up his nose 
at him.’ Perhaps the chief element was that peculiar ‘poor 
man’s pride,’ which compels many poor people to spend 
their last savings on some traditional social ceremony, sim -
ply in order to do ‘like other people,’ and not to ‘be looked 
down upon.’ It is very probable, too, that Katerina Ivanovna 
longed on this occasion, at the moment when she seemed 
to be abandoned by everyone, to show those ‘wretched con -
temptible lodgers’ that she knew ‘how to do things, how to 
entertain’ and that she had been brought up ‘in a genteel, she 
might almost say aristocratic colonel’s family’ and had not 
been meant for sweeping floors and washing the children’s 
rags at night. Even the poorest and most broken-spirited 
people are sometimes liable to these paroxysms of pride 
and vanity which take the form of an irresistible nervous 
craving. And Katerina Ivanovna was not broken-spirited;
Crime and Punishment she might have been killed by circumstance, but her spirit 
could not have been broken, that is, she could not have been 
intimidated, her will could not be crushed. Moreover Sonia 
had said with good reason that her mind was unhinged. She 
could not be said to be insane, but for a year past she had 
been so harassed that her mind might well be overstrained. 
The later stages of consumption are apt, doctors tell us, to 
affect the intellect.
There was no great variety of wines, nor was there Ma -
deira; but wine there was. There was vodka, rum and Lisbon 
wine, all of the poorest quality but in sufficient quantity. Be -
sides the traditional rice and honey, there were three or four 
dishes, one of which consisted of pancakes, all prepared 
in Amalia Ivanovna’s kitchen. Two samovars were boiling, 
that tea and punch might be offered after dinner. Kateri -
na Ivanovna had herself seen to purchasing the provisions, 
with the help of one of the lodgers, an unfortunate little 
Pole who had somehow been stranded at Madame Lippe -
vechsel’s. He promptly put himself at Katerina Ivanovna’s 
disposal and had been all that morning and all the day be -
fore running about as fast as his legs could carry him, and 
very anxious that everyone should be aware of it. For ev -
ery trifle he ran to Katerina Ivanovna, even hunting her out 
at the bazaar, at every instant called her ‘ Pani . ’ She was 
heartily sick of him before the end, though she had de -
clared at first that she could not have got on without this 
‘serviceable and magnanimous man.’ It was one of Katerina 
Ivanovna’s characteristics to paint everyone she met in the 
most glowing colours. Her praises were so exaggerated as Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comsometimes to be embarrassing; she would invent various 
circumstances to the credit of her new acquaintance and 
quite genuinely believe in their reality. Then all of a sudden 
she would be disillusioned and would rudely and contemp -
tuously repulse the person she had only a few hours before 
been literally adoring. She was naturally of a gay, lively and 
peace-loving disposition, but from continual failures and 
misfortunes she had come to desire so keenly  that all should 
live in peace and joy and should not dare  to break the peace, 
that the slightest jar, the smallest disaster reduced her al -
most to frenzy, and she would pass in an instant from the 
brightest hopes and fancies to cursing her fate and raving, 
and knocking her head against the wall.
Amalia Ivanovna, too, suddenly acquired extraordinary 
importance in Katerina Ivanovna’s eyes and was treated 
by her with extraordinary respect, probably only because 
Amalia Ivanovna had thrown herself heart and soul into the 
preparations. She had undertaken to lay the table, to pro -
vide the linen, crockery, etc., and to cook the dishes in her 
kitchen, and Katerina Ivanovna had left it all in her hands 
and gone herself to the cemetery. Everything had been well 
done. Even the table-cloth was nearly clean; the crockery, 
knives, forks and glasses were, of course, of all shapes and 
patterns, lent by different lodgers, but the table was prop -
erly laid at the time fixed, and Amalia Ivanovna, feeling she 
had done her work well, had put on a black silk dress and 
a cap with new mourning ribbons and met the returning 
party with some pride. This pride, though justifiable, dis -
pleased Katerina Ivanovna for some reason: ‘as though the
Crime and Punishment table could not have been laid except by Amalia Ivanovna!’ 
She disliked the cap with new ribbons, too. ‘Could she be 
stuck up, the stupid German, because she was mistress of 
the house, and had consented as a favour to help her poor 
lodgers! As a favour! Fancy that! Katerina Ivanovna’s father 
who had been a colonel and almost a governor had some -
times had the table set for forty persons, and then anyone 
like Amalia Ivanovna, or rather Ludwigovna, would not 
have been allowed into the kitchen.’
Katerina Ivanovna, however, put off expressing her feel -
ings for the time and contented herself with treating her 
coldly, though she decided inwardly that she would cer -
tainly have to put Amalia Ivanovna down and set her in her 
proper place, for goodness only knew what she was fancying 
herself. Katerina Ivanovna was irritated too by the fact that 
hardly any of the lodgers invited had come to the funeral, 
except the Pole who had just managed to run into the cem -
etery, while to the memorial dinner the poorest and most 
insignificant of them had turned up, the wretched creatures, 
many of them not quite sober. The older and more respect -
able of them all, as if by common consent, stayed away. Pyotr 
Petrovitch Luzhin, for instance, who might be said to be the 
most respectable of all the lodgers, did not appear, though 
Katerina Ivanovna had the evening before told all the world, 
that is Amalia Ivanovna, Polenka, Sonia and the Pole, that 
he was the most generous, noble-hearted man with a large 
property and vast connections, who had been a friend of 
her first husband’s, and a guest in her father’s house, and 
that he had promised to use all his influence to secure her a Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comconsiderable pension. It must be noted that when Katerina 
Ivanovna exalted anyone’s connections and fortune, it was 
without any ulterior motive, quite disinterestedly, for the 
mere pleasure of adding to the consequence of the person 
praised. Probably ‘taking his cue’ from Luzhin, ‘that con -
temptible wretch Lebeziatnikov had not turned up either. 
What did he fancy himself? He was only asked out of kind -
ness and because he was sharing the same room with Pyotr 
Petrovitch and was a friend of his, so that it would have 
been awkward not to invite him.’
Among those who failed to appear were ‘the genteel lady 
and her old- maidish daughter,’ who had only been lodg -
ers in the house for the last fortnight, but had several times 
complained of the noise and uproar in Katerina Ivanovna’s 
room, especially when Marmeladov had come back drunk. 
Katerina Ivanovna heard this from Amalia Ivanovna who, 
quarrelling with Katerina Ivanovna, and threatening to turn 
the whole family out of doors, had shouted at her that they 
‘were not worth the foot’ of the honourable lodgers whom 
they were disturbing. Katerina Ivanovna determined now 
to invite this lady and her daughter, ‘whose foot she was not 
worth,’ and who had turned away haughtily when she casu -
ally met them, so that they might know that ‘she was more 
noble in her thoughts and feelings and did not harbour mal -
ice,’ and might see that she was not accustomed to her way 
of living. She had proposed to make this clear to them at 
dinner with allusions to her late father’s governorship, and 
also at the same time to hint that it was exceedingly stupid 
of them to turn away on meeting her. The fat colonel-major
Crime and Punishment (he was really a discharged officer of low rank) was also ab -
sent, but it appeared that he had been ‘not himself’ for the 
last two days. The party consisted of the Pole, a wretched 
looking clerk with a spotty face and a greasy coat, who had 
not a word to say for himself, and smelt abominably, a deaf 
and almost blind old man who had once been in the post of -
fice and who had been from immemorial ages maintained 
by someone at Amalia Ivanovna’s.
A retired clerk of the commissariat department came, 
too; he was drunk, had a loud and most unseemly laugh and 
only fancy—was without a waistcoat! One of the visitors sat 
straight down to the table without even greeting Katerina 
Ivanovna. Finally one person having no suit appeared in 
his dressing-gown, but this was too much, and the efforts 
of Amalia Ivanovna and the Pole succeeded in removing 
him. The Pole brought with him, however, two other Poles 
who did not live at Amalia Ivanovna’s and whom no one 
had seen here before. All this irritated Katerina Ivanovna 
intensely. ‘For whom had they made all these preparations 
then?’ To make room for the visitors the children had not 
even been laid for at the table; but the two little ones were 
sitting on a bench in the furthest corner with their dinner 
laid on a box, while Polenka as a big girl had to look after 
them, feed them, and keep their noses wiped like well-bred 
children’s.
Katerina Ivanovna, in fact, could hardly help meeting 
her guests with increased dignity, and even haughtiness. 
She stared at some of them with special severity, and loftily 
invited them to take their seats. Rushing to the conclusion Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comthat Amalia Ivanovna must be responsible for those who 
were absent, she began treating her with extreme noncha -
lance, which the latter promptly observed and resented. 
Such a beginning was no good omen for the end. All were 
seated at last.
Raskolnikov came in almost at the moment of their re -
turn from the cemetery. Katerina Ivanovna was greatly 
delighted to see him, in the first place, because he was the 
one ‘educated visitor, and, as everyone knew, was in two 
years to take a professorship in the university,’ and sec -
ondly because he immediately and respectfully apologised 
for having been unable to be at the funeral. She positive -
ly pounced upon him, and made him sit on her left hand 
(Amalia Ivanovna was on her right). In spite of her continu -
al anxiety that the dishes should be passed round correctly 
and that everyone should taste them, in spite of the agonis -
ing cough which interrupted her every minute and seemed 
to have grown worse during the last few days, she hastened 
to pour out in a half whisper to Raskolnikov all her sup -
pressed feelings and her just indignation at the failure of 
the dinner, interspersing her remarks with lively and un -
controllable laughter at the expense of her visitors and 
especially of her landlady.
‘It’s all that cuckoo’s fault! You know whom I mean? 
Her, her!’ Katerina Ivanovna nodded towards the landlady. 
‘Look at her, she’s making round eyes, she feels that we are 
talking about her and can’t understand. Pfoo, the owl! Ha-
ha! (Cough-cough-cough.) And what does she put on that 
cap for? (Cough-cough-cough.) Have you noticed that she
Crime and Punishment wants everyone to consider that she is patronising me and 
doing me an honour by being here? I asked her like a sen -
sible woman to invite people, especially those who knew my 
late husband, and look at the set of fools she has brought! 
The sweeps! Look at that one with the spotty face. And 
those wretched Poles, ha-ha-ha! (Cough-cough-cough.) 
Not one of them has ever poked his nose in here, I’ve nev -
er set eyes on them. What have they come here for, I ask 
you? There they sit in a row. Hey, pan!’ she cried suddenly 
to one of them, ‘have you tasted the pancakes? Take some 
more! Have some beer! Won’t you have some vodka? Look, 
he’s jumped up and is making his bows, they must be quite 
starved, poor things. Never mind, let them eat! They don’t 
make a noise, anyway, though I’m really afraid for our land -
lady’s silver spoons … Amalia Ivanovna!’ she addressed her 
suddenly, almost aloud, ‘if your spoons should happen to 
be stolen, I won’t be responsible, I warn you! Ha-ha-ha!’ 
She laughed turning to Raskolnikov, and again nodding 
towards the landlady, in high glee at her sally. ‘She didn’t 
understand, she didn’t understand again! Look how she sits 
with her mouth open! An owl, a real owl! An owl in new rib -
bons, ha-ha-ha!’
Here her laugh turned again to an insufferable fit of 
coughing that lasted five minutes. Drops of perspiration 
stood out on her forehead and her handkerchief was stained 
with blood. She showed Raskolnikov the blood in silence, 
and as soon as she could get her breath began whispering 
to him again with extreme animation and a hectic flush on 
her cheeks. Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com‘Do you know, I gave her the most delicate instructions, 
so to speak, for inviting that lady and her daughter, you 
understand of whom I am speaking? It needed the utmost 
delicacy, the greatest nicety, but she has managed things so 
that that fool, that conceited baggage, that provincial non -
entity, simply because she is the widow of a major, and has 
come to try and get a pension and to fray out her skirts in 
the government offices, because at fifty she paints her face 
(everybody knows it) … a creature like that did not think fit 
to come, and has not even answered the invitation, which 
the most ordinary good manners required! I can’t under -
stand why Pyotr Petrovitch has not come? But where’s 
Sonia? Where has she gone? Ah, there she is at last! what 
is it, Sonia, where have you been? It’s odd that even at your 
father’s funeral you should be so unpunctual. Rodion Ro -
manovitch, make room for her beside you. That’s your place, 
Sonia … take what you like. Have some of the cold entrée 
with jelly, that’s the best. They’ll bring the pancakes direct -
ly. Have they given the children some? Polenka, have you 
got everything? (Cough-cough-cough.) That’s all right. Be 
a good girl, Lida, and, Kolya, don’t fidget with your feet; sit 
like a little gentleman. What are you saying, Sonia?’
Sonia hastened to give her Pyotr Petrovitch’s apolo -
gies, trying to speak loud enough for everyone to hear and 
carefully choosing the most respectful phrases which she 
attributed to Pyotr Petrovitch. She added that Pyotr Petro -
vitch had particularly told her to say that, as soon as he 
possibly could, he would come immediately to discuss busi-
ness alone with her and to consider what could be done for
Crime and Punishment 0her, etc., etc.
Sonia knew that this would comfort Katerina Ivanovna, 
would flatter her and gratify her pride. She sat down be -
side Raskolnikov; she made him a hurried bow, glancing 
curiously at him. But for the rest of the time she seemed to 
avoid looking at him or speaking to him. She seemed ab -
sent-minded, though she kept looking at Katerina Ivanovna, 
trying to please her. Neither she nor Katerina Ivanovna had 
been able to get mourning; Sonia was wearing dark brown, 
and Katerina Ivanovna had on her only dress, a dark striped 
cotton one.
The message from Pyotr Petrovitch was very successful. 
Listening to Sonia with dignity, Katerina Ivanovna inquired 
with equal dignity how Pyotr Petrovitch was, then at once 
whispered almost aloud to Raskolnikov that it certainly 
would have been strange for a man of Pyotr Petrovitch’s po -
sition and standing to find himself in such ‘extraordinary 
company,’ in spite of his devotion to her family and his old 
friendship with her father.
‘That’s why I am so grateful to you, Rodion Romanovitch, 
that you have not disdained my hospitality, even in such 
surroundings,’ she added almost aloud. ‘But I am sure that 
it was only your special affection for my poor husband that 
has made you keep your promise.’
Then once more with pride and dignity she scanned her 
visitors, and suddenly inquired aloud across the table of the 
deaf man: ‘Wouldn’t he have some more meat, and had he 
been given some wine?’ The old man made no answer and 
for a long while could not understand what he was asked, Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comthough his neighbours amused themselves by poking and 
shaking him. He simply gazed about him with his mouth 
open, which only increased the general mirth.
‘What an imbecile! Look, look! Why was he brought? 
But as to Pyotr Petrovitch, I always had confidence in him,’ 
Katerina Ivanovna continued, ‘and, of course, he is not 
like …’ with an extremely stern face she addressed Amalia 
Ivanovna so sharply and loudly that the latter was quite dis -
concerted, ‘not like your dressed up draggletails whom my 
father would not have taken as cooks into his kitchen, and 
my late husband would have done them honour if he had 
invited them in the goodness of his heart.’
‘Yes, he was fond of drink, he was fond of it, he did drink!’ 
cried the commissariat clerk, gulping down his twelfth 
glass of vodka.
‘My late husband certainly had that weakness, and every -
one knows it,’ Katerina Ivanovna attacked him at once, ‘but 
he was a kind and honourable man, who loved and respect -
ed his family. The worst of it was his good nature made him 
trust all sorts of disreputable people, and he drank with fel -
lows who were not worth the sole of his shoe. Would you 
believe it, Rodion Romanovitch, they found a gingerbread 
cock in his pocket; he was dead drunk, but he did not forget 
the children!’
‘A cock? Did you say a cock?’ shouted the commissariat 
clerk.
Katerina Ivanovna did not vouchsafe a reply. She sighed, 
lost in thought.
‘No doubt you think, like everyone, that I was too se -
Crime and Punishment vere with him,’ she went on, addressing Raskolnikov. ‘But 
that’s not so! He respected me, he respected me very much! 
He was a kind-hearted man! And how sorry I was for him 
sometimes! He would sit in a corner and look at me, I used 
to feel so sorry for him, I used to want to be kind to him 
and then would think to myself: ‘Be kind to him and he will 
drink again,’ it was only by severity that you could keep him 
within bounds.’
‘Yes, he used to get his hair pulled pretty often,’ roared 
the commissariat clerk again, swallowing another glass of 
vodka.
‘Some fools would be the better for a good drubbing, as 
well as having their hair pulled. I am not talking of my late 
husband now!’ Katerina Ivanovna snapped at him.
The flush on her cheeks grew more and more marked, her 
chest heaved. In another minute she would have been ready 
to make a scene. Many of the visitors were sniggering, evi -
dently delighted. They began poking the commissariat clerk 
and whispering something to him. They were evidently try -
ing to egg him on.
‘Allow me to ask what are you alluding to,’ began the 
clerk, ‘that is to say, whose … about whom … did you say 
just now … But I don’t care! That’s nonsense! Widow! I for -
give you…. Pass!’
And he took another drink of vodka.
Raskolnikov sat in silence, listening with disgust. He only 
ate from politeness, just tasting the food that Katerina Iva -
novna was continually putting on his plate, to avoid hurting 
her feelings. He watched Sonia intently. But Sonia became Free eBooks at Planet eBook.commore and more anxious and distressed; she, too, foresaw 
that the dinner would not end peaceably, and saw with ter -
ror Katerina Ivanovna’s growing irritation. She knew that 
she, Sonia, was the chief reason for the ‘genteel’ ladies’ con -
temptuous treatment of Katerina Ivanovna’s invitation. She 
had heard from Amalia Ivanovna that the mother was posi -
tively offended at the invitation and had asked the question: 
‘How could she let her daughter sit down beside that young 
person ?’ Sonia had a feeling that Katerina Ivanovna had 
already heard this and an insult to Sonia meant more to 
Katerina Ivanovna than an insult to herself, her children, or 
her father, Sonia knew that Katerina Ivanovna would not 
be satisfied now, ‘till she had shown those draggletails that 
they were both …’ To make matters worse someone passed 
Sonia, from the other end of the table, a plate with two 
hearts pierced with an arrow, cut out of black bread. Kateri -
na Ivanovna flushed crimson and at once said aloud across 
the table that the man who sent it was ‘a drunken ass!’
Amalia Ivanovna was foreseeing something amiss, and 
at the same time deeply wounded by Katerina Ivanovna’s 
haughtiness, and to restore the good-humour of the com -
pany and raise herself in their esteem she began, apropos of 
nothing, telling a story about an acquaintance of hers ‘Karl 
from the chemist’s,’ who was driving one night in a cab, and 
that ‘the cabman wanted him to kill, and Karl very much 
begged him not to kill, and wept and clasped hands, and 
frightened and from fear pierced his heart.’ Though Kat -
erina Ivanovna smiled, she observed at once that Amalia 
Ivanovna ought not to tell anecdotes in Russian; the latter
Crime and Punishment was still more offended, and she retorted that her ‘ Vater aus 
Berlin  was a very important man, and always went with his 
hands in pockets.’ Katerina Ivanovna could not restrain 
herself and laughed so much that Amalia Ivanovna lost pa -
tience and could scarcely control herself.
‘Listen to the owl!’ Katerina Ivanovna whispered at once, 
her good- humour almost restored, ‘she meant to say he 
kept his hands in his pockets, but she said he put his hands 
in people’s pockets. (Cough- cough.) And have you noticed, 
Rodion Romanovitch, that all these Petersburg foreign -
ers, the Germans especially, are all stupider than we! Can 
you fancy anyone of us telling how ‘Karl from the chemist’s’ 
‘pierced his heart from fear’ and that the idiot, instead of 
punishing the cabman, ‘clasped his hands and wept, and 
much begged.’ Ah, the fool! And you know she fancies it’s 
very touching and does not suspect how stupid she is! To my 
thinking that drunken commissariat clerk is a great deal 
cleverer, anyway one can see that he has addled his brains 
with drink, but you know, these foreigners are always so 
well behaved and serious…. Look how she sits glaring! She 
is angry, ha-ha! (Cough-cough-cough.)’
Regaining her good-humour, Katerina Ivanovna began 
at once telling Raskolnikov that when she had obtained her 
pension, she intended to open a school for the daughters 
of gentlemen in her native town T——. This was the first 
time she had spoken to him of the project, and she launched 
out into the most alluring details. It suddenly appeared that 
Katerina Ivanovna had in her hands the very certificate of 
honour of which Marmeladov had spoken to Raskolnikov Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comin the tavern, when he told him that Katerina Ivanovna, his 
wife, had danced the shawl dance before the governor and 
other great personages on leaving school. This certificate of 
honour was obviously intended now to prove Katerina Iva -
novna’s right to open a boarding-school; but she had armed 
herself with it chiefly with the object of overwhelming 
‘those two stuck-up draggletails’ if they came to the din -
ner, and proving incontestably that Katerina Ivanovna was 
of the most noble, ‘she might even say aristocratic family, a 
colonel’s daughter and was far superior to certain adven -
turesses who have been so much to the fore of late.’ The 
certificate of honour immediately passed into the hands of 
the drunken guests, and Katerina Ivanovna did not try to 
retain it, for it actually contained the statement en toutes 
lettres  that her father was of the rank of a major, and also 
a companion of an order, so that she really was almost the 
daughter of a colonel.
Warming up, Katerina Ivanovna proceeded to enlarge 
on the peaceful and happy life they would lead in T——, 
on the gymnasium teachers whom she would engage to 
give lessons in her boarding-school, one a most respect -
able old Frenchman, one Mangot, who had taught Katerina 
Ivanovna herself in old days and was still living in T——, 
and would no doubt teach in her school on moderate terms. 
Next she spoke of Sonia who would go with her to T—— 
and help her in all her plans. At this someone at the further 
end of the table gave a sudden guffaw.
Though Katerina Ivanovna tried to appear to be disdain -
fully unaware of it, she raised her voice and began at once
Crime and Punishment speaking with conviction of Sonia’s undoubted ability to 
assist her, of ‘her gentleness, patience, devotion, generosity 
and good education,’ tapping Sonia on the cheek and kiss -
ing her warmly twice. Sonia flushed crimson, and Katerina 
Ivanovna suddenly burst into tears, immediately observing 
that she was ‘nervous and silly, that she was too much upset, 
that it was time to finish, and as the dinner was over, it was 
time to hand round the tea.’
At that moment, Amalia Ivanovna, deeply aggrieved at 
taking no part in the conversation, and not being listened 
to, made one last effort, and with secret misgivings ven -
tured on an exceedingly deep and weighty observation, that 
‘in the future boarding-school she would have to pay partic -
ular attention to die Wäsche  and that there certainly must 
be a good dame  to look after the linen, and secondly that 
the young ladies must not novels at night read.’
Katerina Ivanovna, who certainly was upset and very 
tired, as well as heartily sick of the dinner, at once cut short 
Amalia Ivanovna, saying ‘she knew nothing about it and 
was talking nonsense, that it was the business of the laundry 
maid, and not of the directress of a high- class boarding-
school to look after die Wäsche  and as for novel- reading, 
that was simply rudeness, and she begged her to be silent.’ 
Amalia Ivanovna fired up and getting angry observed that 
she only ‘meant her good,’ and that ‘she had meant her very 
good,’ and that ‘it was long since she had paid her gold for 
the lodgings.’
Katerina Ivanovna at once ‘set her down,’ saying that it 
was a lie to say she wished her good, because only yester - Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comday when her dead husband was lying on the table, she had 
worried her about the lodgings. To this Amalia Ivanovna 
very appropriately observed that she had invited those la -
dies, but ‘those ladies had not come, because those ladies 
are ladies and cannot come to a lady who is not a lady.’ Kat -
erina Ivanovna at once pointed out to her, that as she was a 
slut she could not judge what made one really a lady. Amalia 
Ivanovna at once declared that her ‘ Vater aus Berlin  was a 
very, very important man, and both hands in pockets went, 
and always used to say: ‘Poof! poof!’’ and she leapt up from 
the table to represent her father, sticking her hands in her 
pockets, puffing her cheeks, and uttering vague sounds 
resembling ‘poof! poof!’ amid loud laughter from all the 
lodgers, who purposely encouraged Amalia Ivanovna, hop -
ing for a fight.
But this was too much for Katerina Ivanovna, and she at 
once declared, so that all could hear, that Amalia Ivanov -
na probably never had a father, but was simply a drunken 
Petersburg Finn, and had certainly once been a cook and 
probably something worse. Amalia Ivanovna turned as red 
as a lobster and squealed that perhaps Katerina Ivanovna 
never had a father, ‘but she had a Vater aus Berlin  and that 
he wore a long coat and always said poof-poof-poof!’
Katerina Ivanovna observed contemptuously that all 
knew what her family was and that on that very certificate 
of honour it was stated in print that her father was a colonel, 
while Amalia Ivanovna’s father—if she really had one—was 
probably some Finnish milkman, but that probably she 
never had a father at all, since it was still uncertain whether
Crime and Punishment her name was Amalia Ivanovna or Amalia Ludwigovna.
At this Amalia Ivanovna, lashed to fury, struck the 
table with her fist, and shrieked that she was Amalia Iva -
novna, and not Ludwigovna, ‘that her Vater  was named 
Johann and that he was a burgomeister, and that Katerina 
Ivanovna’s Vater  was quite never a burgomeister.’ Katerina 
Ivanovna rose from her chair, and with a stern and appar -
ently calm voice (though she was pale and her chest was 
heaving) observed that ‘if she dared for one moment to set 
her contemptible wretch of a father on a level with her papa, 
she, Katerina Ivanovna, would tear her cap off her head 
and trample it under foot.’ Amalia Ivanovna ran about the 
room, shouting at the top of her voice, that she was mistress 
of the house and that Katerina Ivanovna should leave the 
lodgings that minute; then she rushed for some reason to 
collect the silver spoons from the table. There was a great 
outcry and uproar, the children began crying. Sonia ran 
to restrain Katerina Ivanovna, but when Amalia Ivanovna 
shouted something about ‘the yellow ticket,’ Katerina Iva -
novna pushed Sonia away, and rushed at the landlady to 
carry out her threat.
At that minute the door opened, and Pyotr Petrovitch 
Luzhin appeared on the threshold. He stood scanning the 
party with severe and vigilant eyes. Katerina Ivanovna 
rushed to him. Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comChapter III
‘Pyotr Petrovitch,’ she cried, ‘protect me … you at least! 
Make this foolish woman understand that she can’t be -
have like this to a lady in misfortune … that there is a law 
for such things…. I’ll go to the governor-general himself…. 
She shall answer for it…. Remembering my father’s hospi -
tality protect these orphans.’
‘Allow me, madam…. Allow me.’ Pyotr Petrovitch waved 
her off. ‘Your papa as you are well aware I had not the hon -
our of knowing’ (someone laughed aloud) ‘and I do not 
intend to take part in your everlasting squabbles with Ama -
lia Ivanovna…. I have come here to speak of my own affairs 
… and I want to have a word with your stepdaughter, Sofya 
… Ivanovna, I think it is? Allow me to pass.’
Pyotr Petrovitch, edging by her, went to the opposite 
corner where Sonia was.
Katerina Ivanovna remained standing where she was, 
as though thunderstruck. She could not understand how 
Pyotr Petrovitch could deny having enjoyed her father’s 
hospitility. Though she had invented it herself, she believed 
in it firmly by this time. She was struck too by the business -
like, dry and even contemptuous menacing tone of Pyotr 
Petrovitch. All the clamour gradually died away at his en -
trance. Not only was this ‘serious business man’ strikingly 
incongruous with the rest of the party, but it was evident,
Crime and Punishment 0too, that he had come upon some matter of consequence, 
that some exceptional cause must have brought him and 
that therefore something was going to happen. Raskolnikov, 
standing beside Sonia, moved aside to let him pass; Pyotr 
Petrovitch did not seem to notice him. A minute later Lebe -
ziatnikov, too, appeared in the doorway; he did not come in, 
but stood still, listening with marked interest, almost won -
der, and seemed for a time perplexed.
‘Excuse me for possibly interrupting you, but it’s a matter 
of some importance,’ Pyotr Petrovitch observed, address -
ing the company generally. ‘I am glad indeed to find other 
persons present. Amalia Ivanovna, I humbly beg you as 
mistress of the house to pay careful attention to what I have 
to say to Sofya Ivanovna. Sofya Ivanovna,’ he went on, ad -
dressing Sonia, who was very much surprised and already 
alarmed, ‘immediately after your visit I found that a hun -
dred-rouble note was missing from my table, in the room 
of my friend Mr. Lebeziatnikov. If in any way whatever you 
know and will tell us where it is now, I assure you on my 
word of honour and call all present to witness that the mat -
ter shall end there. In the opposite case I shall be compelled 
to have recourse to very serious measures and then … you 
must blame yourself.’
Complete silence reigned in the room. Even the cry -
ing children were still. Sonia stood deadly pale, staring at 
Luzhin and unable to say a word. She seemed not to under -
stand. Some seconds passed.
‘Well, how is it to be then?’ asked Luzhin, looking intent -
ly at her. Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com‘I don’t know…. I know nothing about it,’ Sonia articu -
lated faintly at last.
‘No, you know nothing?’ Luzhin repeated and again he 
paused for some seconds. ‘Think a moment, mademoiselle,’ 
he began severely, but still, as it were, admonishing her. 
‘Reflect, I am prepared to give you time for consideration. 
Kindly observe this: if I were not so entirely convinced I 
should not, you may be sure, with my experience venture 
to accuse you so directly. Seeing that for such direct accu -
sation before witnesses, if false or even mistaken, I should 
myself in a certain sense be made responsible, I am aware 
of that. This morning I changed for my own purposes sev -
eral five-per-cent securities for the sum of approximately 
three thousand roubles. The account is noted down in my 
pocket-book. On my return home I proceeded to count the 
money—as Mr. Lebeziatnikov will bear witness—and after 
counting two thousand three hundred roubles I put the rest 
in my pocket-book in my coat pocket. About five hundred 
roubles remained on the table and among them three notes 
of a hundred roubles each. At that moment you entered (at 
my invitation)—and all the time you were present you were 
exceedingly embarrassed; so that three times you jumped 
up in the middle of the conversation and tried to make off. 
Mr. Lebeziatnikov can bear witness to this. You yourself, 
mademoiselle, probably will not refuse to confirm my state -
ment that I invited you through Mr. Lebeziatnikov, solely 
in order to discuss with you the hopeless and destitute po -
sition of your relative, Katerina Ivanovna (whose dinner 
I was unable to attend), and the advisability of getting up
Crime and Punishment something of the nature of a subscription, lottery or the 
like, for her benefit. You thanked me and even shed tears. 
I describe all this as it took place, primarily to recall it to 
your mind and secondly to show you that not the slightest 
detail has escaped my recollection. Then I took a ten- rou -
ble note from the table and handed it to you by way of first 
instalment on my part for the benefit of your relative. Mr. 
Lebeziatnikov saw all this. Then I accompanied you to the 
door—you being still in the same state of embarrassment—
after which, being left alone with Mr. Lebeziatnikov I talked 
to him for ten minutes— then Mr. Lebeziatnikov went out 
and I returned to the table with the money lying on it, in -
tending to count it and to put it aside, as I proposed doing 
before. To my surprise one hundred-rouble note had disap -
peared. Kindly consider the position. Mr. Lebeziatnikov I 
cannot suspect. I am ashamed to allude to such a suppo -
sition. I cannot have made a mistake in my reckoning, for 
the minute before your entrance I had finished my accounts 
and found the total correct. You will admit that recollect -
ing your embarrassment, your eagerness to get away and 
the fact that you kept your hands for some time on the table, 
and taking into consideration your social position and the 
habits associated with it, I was, so to say, with horror and 
positively against my will, compelled  to entertain a suspi -
cion—a cruel, but justifiable suspicion! I will add further 
and repeat that in spite of my positive conviction, I realise 
that I run a certain risk in making this accusation, but as 
you see, I could not let it pass. I have taken action and I will 
tell you why: solely, madam, solely, owing to your black in - Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comgratitude! Why! I invite you for the benefit of your destitute 
relative, I present you with my donation of ten roubles and 
you, on the spot, repay me for all that with such an action. It 
is too bad! You need a lesson. Reflect! Moreover, like a true 
friend I beg you— and you could have no better friend at 
this moment—think what you are doing, otherwise I shall 
be immovable! Well, what do you say?’
‘I have taken nothing,’ Sonia whispered in terror, ‘you 
gave me ten roubles, here it is, take it.’
Sonia pulled her handkerchief out of her pocket, untied 
a corner of it, took out the ten-rouble note and gave it to 
Luzhin.
‘And the hundred roubles you do not confess to taking?’ 
he insisted reproachfully, not taking the note.
Sonia looked about her. All were looking at her with such 
awful, stern, ironical, hostile eyes. She looked at Raskol -
nikov … he stood against the wall, with his arms crossed, 
looking at her with glowing eyes.
‘Good God!’ broke from Sonia.
‘Amalia Ivanovna, we shall have to send word to the po -
lice and therefore I humbly beg you meanwhile to send for 
the house porter,’ Luzhin said softly and even kindly.
‘Gott der Barmherzige ! I knew she was the thief,’ cried 
Amalia Ivanovna, throwing up her hands.
‘You knew it?’ Luzhin caught her up, ‘then I suppose you 
had some reason before this for thinking so. I beg you, wor -
thy Amalia Ivanovna, to remember your words which have 
been uttered before witnesses.’
There was a buzz of loud conversation on all sides. All
Crime and Punishment were in movement.
‘What!’ cried Katerina Ivanovna, suddenly realising the 
position, and she rushed at Luzhin. ‘What! You accuse her 
of stealing? Sonia? Ah, the wretches, the wretches!’
And running to Sonia she flung her wasted arms round 
her and held her as in a vise.
‘Sonia! how dared you take ten roubles from him? Foolish 
girl! Give it to me! Give me the ten roubles at once—here!
And snatching the note from Sonia, Katerina Ivanovna 
crumpled it up and flung it straight into Luzhin’s face. It 
hit him in the eye and fell on the ground. Amalia Ivanovna 
hastened to pick it up. Pyotr Petrovitch lost his temper.
‘Hold that mad woman!’ he shouted.
At that moment several other persons, besides Lebezi -
atnikov, appeared in the doorway, among them the two 
ladies.
‘What! Mad? Am I mad? Idiot!’ shrieked Katerina Iva -
novna. ‘You are an idiot yourself, pettifogging lawyer, base 
man! Sonia, Sonia take his money! Sonia a thief! Why, she’d 
give away her last penny!’ and Katerina Ivanovna broke 
into hysterical laughter. ‘Did you ever see such an idiot?’ 
she turned from side to side. ‘And you too?’ she suddenly 
saw the landlady, ‘and you too, sausage eater, you declare 
that she is a thief, you trashy Prussian hen’s leg in a crino -
line! She hasn’t been out of this room: she came straight 
from you, you wretch, and sat down beside me, everyone 
saw her. She sat here, by Rodion Romanovitch. Search her! 
Since she’s not left the room, the money would have to be 
on her! Search her, search her! But if you don’t find it, then Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comexcuse me, my dear fellow, you’ll answer for it! I’ll go to 
our Sovereign, to our Sovereign, to our gracious Tsar him -
self, and throw myself at his feet, to-day, this minute! I am 
alone in the world! They would let me in! Do you think they 
wouldn’t? You’re wrong, I will get in! I will get in! You reck -
oned on her meekness! You relied upon that! But I am not 
so submissive, let me tell you! You’ve gone too far yourself. 
Search her, search her!’
And Katerina Ivanovna in a frenzy shook Luzhin and 
dragged him towards Sonia.
‘I am ready, I’ll be responsible … but calm yourself, mad -
am, calm yourself. I see that you are not so submissive! … 
Well, well, but as to that …’ Luzhin muttered, ‘that ought to 
be before the police … though indeed there are witnesses 
enough as it is…. I am ready…. But in any case it’s difficult 
for a man … on account of her sex…. But with the help of 
Amalia Ivanovna … though, of course, it’s not the way to do 
things…. How is it to be done?’
‘As you will! Let anyone who likes search her!’ cried Kat -
erina Ivanovna. ‘Sonia, turn out your pockets! See! Look, 
monster, the pocket is empty, here was her handkerchief! 
Here is the other pocket, look! D’you see, d’you see?’
And Katerina Ivanovna turned—or rather snatched—
both pockets inside out. But from the right pocket a piece 
of paper flew out and describing a parabola in the air fell 
at Luzhin’s feet. Everyone saw it, several cried out. Pyotr 
Petrovitch stooped down, picked up the paper in two fin -
gers, lifted it where all could see it and opened it. It was a 
hundred-rouble note folded in eight. Pyotr Petrovitch held
Crime and Punishment up the note showing it to everyone.
‘Thief! Out of my lodging. Police, police!’ yelled Amalia 
Ivanovna. ‘They must to Siberia be sent! Away!’
Exclamations arose on all sides. Raskolnikov was silent, 
keeping his eyes fixed on Sonia, except for an occasional 
rapid glance at Luzhin. Sonia stood still, as though uncon -
scious. She was hardly able to feel surprise. Suddenly the 
colour rushed to her cheeks; she uttered a cry and hid her 
face in her hands.
‘No, it wasn’t I! I didn’t take it! I know nothing about it,’ 
she cried with a heartrending wail, and she ran to Katerina 
Ivanovna, who clasped her tightly in her arms, as though 
she would shelter her from all the world.
‘Sonia! Sonia! I don’t believe it! You see, I don’t believe it!’ 
she cried in the face of the obvious fact, swaying her to and 
fro in her arms like a baby, kissing her face continually, then 
snatching at her hands and kissing them, too, ‘you took it! 
How stupid these people are! Oh dear! You are fools, fools,’ 
she cried, addressing the whole room, ‘you don’t know, you 
don’t know what a heart she has, what a girl she is! She take 
it, she? She’d sell her last rag, she’d go barefoot to help you 
if you needed it, that’s what she is! She has the yellow pass -
port because my children were starving, she sold herself for 
us! Ah, husband, husband! Do you see? Do you see? What 
a memorial dinner for you! Merciful heavens! Defend her, 
why are you all standing still? Rodion Romanovitch, why 
don’t you stand up for her? Do you believe it, too? You are 
not worth her little finger, all of you together! Good God! 
Defend her now, at least!’ Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comThe wail of the poor, consumptive, helpless woman 
seemed to produce a great effect on her audience. The ago -
nised, wasted, consumptive face, the parched blood-stained 
lips, the hoarse voice, the tears unrestrained as a child’s, the 
trustful, childish and yet despairing prayer for help were so 
piteous that everyone seemed to feel for her. Pyotr Petro -
vitch at any rate was at once moved to compassion .
‘Madam, madam, this incident does not reflect upon you!’ 
he cried impressively, ‘no one would take upon himself to 
accuse you of being an instigator or even an accomplice in 
it, especially as you have proved her guilt by turning out 
her pockets, showing that you had no previous idea of it. I 
am most ready, most ready to show compassion, if pover -
ty, so to speak, drove Sofya Semyonovna to it, but why did 
you refuse to confess, mademoiselle? Were you afraid of the 
disgrace? The first step? You lost your head, perhaps? One 
can quite understand it…. But how could you have lowered 
yourself to such an action? Gentlemen,’ he addressed the 
whole company, ‘gentlemen! Compassionate and, so to say, 
commiserating these people, I am ready to overlook it even 
now in spite of the personal insult lavished upon me! And 
may this disgrace be a lesson to you for the future,’ he said, 
addressing Sonia, ‘and I will carry the matter no further. 
Enough!’
Pyotr Petrovitch stole a glance at Raskolnikov. Their eyes 
met, and the fire in Raskolnikov’s seemed ready to reduce 
him to ashes. Meanwhile Katerina Ivanovna apparently 
heard nothing. She was kissing and hugging Sonia like a 
madwoman. The children, too, were embracing Sonia on all
Crime and Punishment sides, and Polenka—though she did not fully understand 
what was wrong—was drowned in tears and shaking with 
sobs, as she hid her pretty little face, swollen with weeping, 
on Sonia’s shoulder.
‘How vile!’ a loud voice cried suddenly in the doorway.
Pyotr Petrovitch looked round quickly.
‘What vileness!’ Lebeziatnikov repeated, staring him 
straight in the face.
Pyotr Petrovitch gave a positive start—all noticed it and 
recalled it afterwards. Lebeziatnikov strode into the room.
‘And you dared to call me as witness?’ he said, going up 
to Pyotr Petrovitch.
‘What do you mean? What are you talking about?’ mut -
tered Luzhin.
‘I mean that you … are a slanderer, that’s what my words 
mean!’ Lebeziatnikov said hotly, looking sternly at him 
with his short- sighted eyes.
He was extremely angry. Raskolnikov gazed intently 
at him, as though seizing and weighing each word. Again 
there was a silence. Pyotr Petrovitch indeed seemed almost 
dumbfounded for the first moment.
‘If you mean that for me, …’ he began, stammering. ‘But 
what’s the matter with you? Are you out of your mind?’
‘I’m in my mind, but you are a scoundrel! Ah, how vile! 
I have heard everything. I kept waiting on purpose to un -
derstand it, for I must own even now it is not quite logical…. 
What you have done it all for I can’t understand.’
‘Why, what have I done then? Give over talking in your 
nonsensical riddles! Or maybe you are drunk!’ Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com‘You may be a drunkard, perhaps, vile man, but I am not! 
I never touch vodka, for it’s against my convictions. Would 
you believe it, he, he himself, with his own hands gave So -
fya Semyonovna that hundred-rouble note—I saw it, I was 
a witness, I’ll take my oath! He did it, he!’ repeated Lebezi -
atnikov, addressing all.
‘Are you crazy, milksop?’ squealed Luzhin. ‘She is her -
self before you —she herself here declared just now before 
everyone that I gave her only ten roubles. How could I have 
given it to her?’
‘I saw it, I saw it,’ Lebeziatnikov repeated, ‘and though 
it is against my principles, I am ready this very minute to 
take any oath you like before the court, for I saw how you 
slipped it in her pocket. Only like a fool I thought you did 
it out of kindness! When you were saying good-bye to her 
at the door, while you held her hand in one hand, with the 
other, the left, you slipped the note into her pocket. I saw it, 
I saw it!’
Luzhin turned pale.
‘What lies!’ he cried impudently, ‘why, how could you, 
standing by the window, see the note? You fancied it with 
your short-sighted eyes. You are raving!’
‘No, I didn’t fancy it. And though I was standing some 
way off, I saw it all. And though it certainly would be hard 
to distinguish a note from the window—that’s true—I knew 
for certain that it was a hundred-rouble note, because, when 
you were going to give Sofya Semyonovna ten roubles, you 
took up from the table a hundred-rouble note (I saw it be -
cause I was standing near then, and an idea struck me at
Crime and Punishment 0once, so that I did not forget you had it in your hand). You 
folded it and kept it in your hand all the time. I didn’t think 
of it again until, when you were getting up, you changed it 
from your right hand to your left and nearly dropped it! I 
noticed it because the same idea struck me again, that you 
meant to do her a kindness without my seeing. You can 
fancy how I watched you and I saw how you succeeded in 
slipping it into her pocket. I saw it, I saw it, I’ll take my 
oath.’
Lebeziatnikov was almost breathless. Exclamations arose 
on all hands chiefly expressive of wonder, but some were 
menacing in tone. They all crowded round Pyotr Petrovitch. 
Katerina Ivanovna flew to Lebeziatnikov.
‘I was mistaken in you! Protect her! You are the only one 
to take her part! She is an orphan. God has sent you!’
Katerina Ivanovna, hardly knowing what she was doing, 
sank on her knees before him.
‘A pack of nonsense!’ yelled Luzhin, roused to fury, ‘it’s 
all nonsense you’ve been talking! ‘An idea struck you, you 
didn’t think, you noticed’—what does it amount to? So I 
gave it to her on the sly on purpose? What for? With what 
object? What have I to do with this …?’
‘What for? That’s what I can’t understand, but that what 
I am telling you is the fact, that’s certain! So far from my 
being mistaken, you infamous criminal man, I remember 
how, on account of it, a question occurred to me at once, 
just when I was thanking you and pressing your hand. 
What made you put it secretly in her pocket? Why you did 
it secretly, I mean? Could it be simply to conceal it from Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comme, knowing that my convictions are opposed to yours 
and that I do not approve of private benevolence, which ef -
fects no radical cure? Well, I decided that you really were 
ashamed of giving such a large sum before me. Perhaps, 
too, I thought, he wants to give her a surprise, when she 
finds a whole hundred-rouble note in her pocket. (For I 
know, some benevolent people are very fond of decking out 
their charitable actions in that way.) Then the idea struck 
me, too, that you wanted to test her, to see whether, when 
she found it, she would come to thank you. Then, too, that 
you wanted to avoid thanks and that, as the saying is, your 
right hand should not know … something of that sort, in 
fact. I thought of so many possibilities that I put off con -
sidering it, but still thought it indelicate to show you that 
I knew your secret. But another idea struck me again that 
Sofya Semyonovna might easily lose the money before she 
noticed it, that was why I decided to come in here to call 
her out of the room and to tell her that you put a hundred 
roubles in her pocket. But on my way I went first to Ma -
dame Kobilatnikov’s to take them the ‘General Treatise on 
the Positive Method’ and especially to recommend Piderit’s 
article (and also Wagner’s); then I come on here and what 
a state of things I find! Now could I, could I, have all these 
ideas and reflections if I had not seen you put the hundred-
rouble note in her pocket?’
When Lebeziatnikov finished his long-winded harangue 
with the logical deduction at the end, he was quite tired, 
and the perspiration streamed from his face. He could not, 
alas, even express himself correctly in Russian, though he
Crime and Punishment knew no other language, so that he was quite exhausted, 
almost emaciated after this heroic exploit. But his speech 
produced a powerful effect. He had spoken with such ve -
hemence, with such conviction that everyone obviously 
believed him. Pyotr Petrovitch felt that things were going 
badly with him.
‘What is it to do with me if silly ideas did occur to you?’ 
he shouted, ‘that’s no evidence. You may have dreamt it, 
that’s all! And I tell you, you are lying, sir. You are lying and 
slandering from some spite against me, simply from pique, 
because I did not agree with your free-thinking, godless, 
social propositions!’
But this retort did not benefit Pyotr Petrovitch. Mur -
murs of disapproval were heard on all sides.
‘Ah, that’s your line now, is it!’ cried Lebeziatnikov, ‘that’s 
nonsense! Call the police and I’ll take my oath! There’s only 
one thing I can’t understand: what made him risk such a 
contemptible action. Oh, pitiful, despicable man!’
‘I can explain why he risked such an action, and if nec -
essary, I, too, will swear to it,’ Raskolnikov said at last in a 
firm voice, and he stepped forward.
He appeared to be firm and composed. Everyone felt 
clearly, from the very look of him that he really knew about 
it and that the mystery would be solved.
‘Now I can explain it all to myself,’ said Raskolnikov, ad -
dressing Lebeziatnikov. ‘From the very beginning of the 
business, I suspected that there was some scoundrelly in -
trigue at the bottom of it. I began to suspect it from some 
special circumstances known to me only, which I will ex - Free eBooks at Planet eBook.complain at once to everyone: they account for everything. Your 
valuable evidence has finally made everything clear to me. I 
beg all, all to listen. This gentleman (he pointed to Luzhin) 
was recently engaged to be married to a young lady—my 
sister, Avdotya Romanovna Raskolnikov. But coming to 
Petersburg he quarrelled with me, the day before yesterday, 
at our first meeting and I drove him out of my room —I 
have two witnesses to prove it. He is a very spiteful man…. 
The day before yesterday I did not know that he was stay -
ing here, in your room, and that consequently on the very 
day we quarrelled—the day before yesterday—he saw me 
give Katerina Ivanovna some money for the funeral, as a 
friend of the late Mr. Marmeladov. He at once wrote a note 
to my mother and informed her that I had given away all my 
money, not to Katerina Ivanovna but to Sofya Semyonovna, 
and referred in a most contemptible way to the … charac -
ter of Sofya Semyonovna, that is, hinted at the character of 
my attitude to Sofya Semyonovna. All this you understand 
was with the object of dividing me from my mother and 
sister, by insinuating that I was squandering on unwor -
thy objects the money which they had sent me and which 
was all they had. Yesterday evening, before my mother and 
sister and in his presence, I declared that I had given the 
money to Katerina Ivanovna for the funeral and not to So -
fya Semyonovna and that I had no acquaintance with Sofya 
Semyonovna and had never seen her before, indeed. At the 
same time I added that he, Pyotr Petrovitch Luzhin, with 
all his virtues, was not worth Sofya Semyonovna’s little fin -
ger, though he spoke so ill of her. To his question—would I
Crime and Punishment let Sofya Semyonovna sit down beside my sister, I answered 
that I had already done so that day. Irritated that my mother 
and sister were unwilling to quarrel with me at his insin -
uations, he gradually began being unpardonably rude to 
them. A final rupture took place and he was turned out of 
the house. All this happened yesterday evening. Now I beg 
your special attention: consider: if he had now succeeded in 
proving that Sofya Semyonovna was a thief, he would have 
shown to my mother and sister that he was almost right in 
his suspicions, that he had reason to be angry at my put -
ting my sister on a level with Sofya Semyonovna, that, in 
attacking me, he was protecting and preserving the honour 
of my sister, his betrothed. In fact he might even, through 
all this, have been able to estrange me from my family, and 
no doubt he hoped to be restored to favour with them; to say 
nothing of revenging himself on me personally, for he has 
grounds for supposing that the honour and happiness of 
Sofya Semyonovna are very precious to me. That was what 
he was working for! That’s how I understand it. That’s the 
whole reason for it and there can be no other!’
It was like this, or somewhat like this, that Raskolnikov 
wound up his speech which was followed very attentively, 
though often interrupted by exclamations from his audi -
ence. But in spite of interruptions he spoke clearly, calmly, 
exactly, firmly. His decisive voice, his tone of conviction 
and his stern face made a great impression on everyone.
‘Yes, yes, that’s it,’ Lebeziatnikov assented gleefully, ‘that 
must be it, for he asked me, as soon as Sofya Semyonovna 
came into our room, whether you were here, whether I had Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comseen you among Katerina Ivanovna’s guests. He called me 
aside to the window and asked me in secret. It was essential 
for him that you should be here! That’s it, that’s it!’
Luzhin smiled contemptuously and did not speak. But 
he was very pale. He seemed to be deliberating on some 
means of escape. Perhaps he would have been glad to give 
up everything and get away, but at the moment this was 
scarcely possible. It would have implied admitting the truth 
of the accusations brought against him. Moreover, the com -
pany, which had already been excited by drink, was now too 
much stirred to allow it. The commissariat clerk, though in -
deed he had not grasped the whole position, was shouting 
louder than anyone and was making some suggestions very 
unpleasant to Luzhin. But not all those present were drunk; 
lodgers came in from all the rooms. The three Poles were 
tremendously excited and were continually shouting at him: 
‘The pan is a lajdak !’ and muttering threats in Polish. Sonia 
had been listening with strained attention, though she too 
seemed unable to grasp it all; she seemed as though she had 
just returned to consciousness. She did not take her eyes off 
Raskolnikov, feeling that all her safety lay in him. Katerina 
Ivanovna breathed hard and painfully and seemed fearful -
ly exhausted. Amalia Ivanovna stood looking more stupid 
than anyone, with her mouth wide open, unable to make 
out what had happened. She only saw that Pyotr Petrovitch 
had somehow come to grief.
Raskolnikov was attempting to speak again, but they 
did not let him. Everyone was crowding round Luzhin with 
threats and shouts of abuse. But Pyotr Petrovitch was not
Crime and Punishment intimidated. Seeing that his accusation of Sonia had com -
pletely failed, he had recourse to insolence:
‘Allow me, gentlemen, allow me! Don’t squeeze, let me 
pass!’ he said, making his way through the crowd. ‘And no 
threats, if you please! I assure you it will be useless, you will

gentlemen, for violently obstructing the course of justice. 
The thief has been more than unmasked, and I shall pros -
ecute. Our judges are not so blind and … not so drunk, 
and will not believe the testimony of two notorious infi -

Yes, allow me to pass!’
‘Don’t let me find a trace of you in my room! Kindly leave 
at once, and everything is at an end between us! When I 
think of the trouble I’ve been taking, the way I’ve been ex -
pounding … all this fortnight!’
‘I told you myself to-day that I was going, when you tried 
to keep me; now I will simply add that you are a fool. I ad -
vise you to see a doctor for your brains and your short sight. 
Let me pass, gentlemen!’
He forced his way through. But the commissariat clerk 
was unwilling to let him off so easily: he picked up a glass 
from the table, brandished it in the air and flung it at Pyotr 
Petrovitch; but the glass flew straight at Amalia Ivanovna. 
She screamed, and the clerk, overbalancing, fell heavily un -
der the table. Pyotr Petrovitch made his way to his room 
and half an hour later had left the house. Sonia, timid by 
nature, had felt before that day that she could be ill- treated Free eBooks at Planet eBook.commore easily than anyone, and that she could be wronged 
with impunity. Yet till that moment she had fancied that she 
might escape misfortune by care, gentleness and submis -
siveness before everyone. Her disappointment was too great. 
She could, of course, bear with patience and almost with -
out murmur anything, even this. But for the first minute 
she felt it too bitter. In spite of her triumph and her justifi -
cation—when her first terror and stupefaction had passed 
and she could understand it all clearly—the feeling of her 
helplessness and of the wrong done to her made her heart 
throb with anguish and she was overcome with hysterical 
weeping. At last, unable to bear any more, she rushed out 
of the room and ran home, almost immediately after Lu -
zhin’s departure. When amidst loud laughter the glass flew 
at Amalia Ivanovna, it was more than the landlady could 
endure. With a shriek she rushed like a fury at Katerina Iva -
novna, considering her to blame for everything.
‘Out of my lodgings! At once! Quick march!’
And with these words she began snatching up every -
thing she could lay her hands on that belonged to Katerina 
Ivanovna, and throwing it on the floor. Katerina Ivanovna, 
pale, almost fainting, and gasping for breath, jumped up 
from the bed where she had sunk in exhaustion and dart -
ed at Amalia Ivanovna. But the battle was too unequal: the 
landlady waved her away like a feather.
‘What! As though that godless calumny was not enough—
this vile creature attacks me! What! On the day of my 
husband’s funeral I am turned out of my lodging! After eat -
ing my bread and salt she turns me into the street, with my
Crime and Punishment orphans! Where am I to go?’ wailed the poor woman, sob -
bing and gasping. ‘Good God!’ she cried with flashing eyes, 
‘is there no justice upon earth? Whom should you protect 
if not us orphans? We shall see! There is law and justice on 
earth, there is, I will find it! Wait a bit, godless creature! Po -
lenka, stay with the children, I’ll come back. Wait for me, if 
you have to wait in the street. We will see whether there is 
justice on earth!’
And throwing over her head that green shawl which 
Marmeladov had mentioned to Raskolnikov, Katerina 
Ivanovna squeezed her way through the disorderly and 
drunken crowd of lodgers who still filled the room, and, 
wailing and tearful, she ran into the street—with a vague 
intention of going at once somewhere to find justice. Polen -
ka with the two little ones in her arms crouched, terrified, 
on the trunk in the corner of the room, where she waited 
trembling for her mother to come back. Amalia Ivanovna 
raged about the room, shrieking, lamenting and throwing 
everything she came across on the floor. The lodgers talked 
incoherently, some commented to the best of their ability 
on what had happened, others quarrelled and swore at one 
another, while others struck up a song….
‘Now it’s time for me to go,’ thought Raskolnikov. ‘Well, 
Sofya Semyonovna, we shall see what you’ll say now!’
And he set off in the direction of Sonia’s lodgings. Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comChapter IV
Raskolnikov had been a vigorous and active champion 
of Sonia against Luzhin, although he had such a load 
of horror and anguish in his own heart. But having gone 
through so much in the morning, he found a sort of relief 
in a change of sensations, apart from the strong personal 
feeling which impelled him to defend Sonia. He was agi -
tated too, especially at some moments, by the thought of his 
approaching interview with Sonia: he had to tell her who 
had killed Lizaveta. He knew the terrible suffering it would 
be to him and, as it were, brushed away the thought of it. 
So when he cried as he left Katerina Ivanovna’s, ‘Well, So -
fya Semyonovna, we shall see what you’ll say now!’ he was 
still superficially excited, still vigorous and defiant from 
his triumph over Luzhin. But, strange to say, by the time 
he reached Sonia’s lodging, he felt a sudden impotence and 
fear. He stood still in hesitation at the door, asking himself 
the strange question: ‘Must he tell her who killed Lizaveta?’ 
It was a strange question because he felt at the very time not 
only that he could not help telling her, but also that he could 
not put off the telling. He did not yet know why it must be 
so, he only felt it, and the agonising sense of his impotence 
before the inevitable almost crushed him. To cut short his 
hesitation and suffering, he quickly opened the door and 
looked at Sonia from the doorway. She was sitting with her
Crime and Punishment 0elbows on the table and her face in her hands, but seeing 
Raskolnikov she got up at once and came to meet him as 
though she were expecting him.
‘What would have become of me but for you?’ she said 
quickly, meeting him in the middle of the room.
Evidently she was in haste to say this to him. It was what 
she had been waiting for.
Raskolnikov went to the table and sat down on the chair 
from which she had only just risen. She stood facing him, 
two steps away, just as she had done the day before.
‘Well, Sonia?’ he said, and felt that his voice was trem -
bling, ‘it was all due to ‘your social position and the habits 
associated with it.’ Did you understand that just now?’
Her face showed her distress.
‘Only don’t talk to me as you did yesterday,’ she inter -
rupted him. ‘Please don’t begin it. There is misery enough 
without that.’
She made haste to smile, afraid that he might not like 
the reproach.
‘I was silly to come away from there. What is happening 
there now? I wanted to go back directly, but I kept thinking 
that … you would come.’
He told her that Amalia Ivanovna was turning them out 
of their lodging and that Katerina Ivanovna had run off  
somewhere ‘to seek justice.’
‘My God!’ cried Sonia, ‘let’s go at once….’
And she snatched up her cape.
‘It’s everlastingly the same thing!’ said Raskolnikov, irri -
tably. ‘You’ve no thought except for them! Stay a little with Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comme.’
‘But … Katerina Ivanovna?’
‘You won’t lose Katerina Ivanovna, you may be sure, 
she’ll come to you herself since she has run out,’ he added 
peevishly. ‘If she doesn’t find you here, you’ll be blamed for 
it….’
Sonia sat down in painful suspense. Raskolnikov was si -
lent, gazing at the floor and deliberating.
‘This time Luzhin did not want to prosecute you,’ he be -
gan, not looking at Sonia, ‘but if he had wanted to, if it had 
suited his plans, he would have sent you to prison if it had 
not been for Lebeziatnikov and me. Ah?’
‘Yes,’ she assented in a faint voice. ‘Yes,’ she repeated, pre -
occupied and distressed.
‘But I might easily not have been there. And it was quite 
an accident Lebeziatnikov’s turning up.’
Sonia was silent.
‘And if you’d gone to prison, what then? Do you remem -
ber what I said yesterday?’
Again she did not answer. He waited.
‘I thought you would cry out again ‘don’t speak of it, 
leave off.’’ Raskolnikov gave a laugh, but rather a forced one. 
‘What, silence again?’ he asked a minute later. ‘We must 
talk about something, you know. It would be interesting 
for me to know how you would decide a certain ‘problem’ 
as Lebeziatnikov would say.’ (He was beginning to lose the 
thread.) ‘No, really, I am serious. Imagine, Sonia, that you 
had known all Luzhin’s intentions beforehand. Known, 
that is, for a fact, that they would be the ruin of Katerina
Crime and Punishment Ivanovna and the children and yourself thrown in—since 
you don’t count yourself for anything—Polenka too … for 
she’ll go the same way. Well, if suddenly it all depended on 
your decision whether he or they should go on living, that 
is whether Luzhin should go on living and doing wicked 
things, or Katerina Ivanovna should die? How would you 
decide which of them was to die? I ask you?’
Sonia looked uneasily at him. There was something pecu -
liar in this hesitating question, which seemed approaching 
something in a roundabout way.
‘I felt that you were going to ask some question like that,’ 
she said, looking inquisitively at him.
‘I dare say you did. But how is it to be answered?’
‘Why do you ask about what could not happen?’ said So -
nia reluctantly.
‘Then it would be better for Luzhin to go on living and do -
ing wicked things? You haven’t dared to decide even that!’
‘But I can’t know the Divine Providence…. And why do 
you ask what can’t be answered? What’s the use of such fool -
ish questions? How could it happen that it should depend 
on my decision—who has made me a judge to decide who is 
to live and who is not to live?’
‘Oh, if the Divine Providence is to be mixed up in it, there 
is no doing anything,’ Raskolnikov grumbled morosely.
‘You’d better say straight out what you want!’ Sonia cried 
in distress. ‘You are leading up to something again…. Can 
you have come simply to torture me?’
She could not control herself and began crying bitterly. 
He looked at her in gloomy misery. Five minutes passed. Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com‘Of course you’re right, Sonia,’ he said softly at last. He 
was suddenly changed. His tone of assumed arrogance and 
helpless defiance was gone. Even his voice was sudden -
ly weak. ‘I told you yesterday that I was not coming to ask 
forgiveness and almost the first thing I’ve said is to ask for -
giveness…. I said that about Luzhin and Providence for my 
own sake. I was asking forgiveness, Sonia….’
He tried to smile, but there was something helpless and 
incomplete in his pale smile. He bowed his head and hid his 
face in his hands.
And suddenly a strange, surprising sensation of a sort of 
bitter hatred for Sonia passed through his heart. As it were 
wondering and frightened of this sensation, he raised his 
head and looked intently at her; but he met her uneasy and 
painfully anxious eyes fixed on him; there was love in them; 
his hatred vanished like a phantom. It was not the real feel -
ing; he had taken the one feeling for the other. It only meant 
that that minute had come.
He hid his face in his hands again and bowed his head. 
Suddenly he turned pale, got up from his chair, looked at 
Sonia, and without uttering a word sat down mechanically 
on her bed.
His sensations that moment were terribly like the mo -
ment when he had stood over the old woman with the axe in 
his hand and felt that ‘he must not lose another minute.’
‘What’s the matter?’ asked Sonia, dreadfully frightened.
He could not utter a word. This was not at all, not at all 
the way he had intended to ‘tell’ and he did not understand 
what was happening to him now. She went up to him, softly,
Crime and Punishment sat down on the bed beside him and waited, not taking her 
eyes off him. Her heart throbbed and sank. It was unendur -
able; he turned his deadly pale face to her. His lips worked, 
helplessly struggling to utter something. A pang of terror 
passed through Sonia’s heart.
‘What’s the matter?’ she repeated, drawing a little away 
from him.
‘Nothing, Sonia, don’t be frightened…. It’s nonsense. 
It really is nonsense, if you think of it,’ he muttered, like 
a man in delirium. ‘Why have I come to torture you?’ he 
added suddenly, looking at her. ‘Why, really? I keep asking 
myself that question, Sonia….’
He had perhaps been asking himself that question 
a quarter of an hour before, but now he spoke helplessly, 
hardly knowing what he said and feeling a continual tremor 
all over.
‘Oh, how you are suffering!’ she muttered in distress, 
looking intently at him.
‘It’s all nonsense…. Listen, Sonia.’ He suddenly smiled, a 
pale helpless smile for two seconds. ‘You remember what I 
meant to tell you yesterday?’
Sonia waited uneasily.
‘I said as I went away that perhaps I was saying good-bye 
for ever, but that if I came to-day I would tell you who … 
who killed Lizaveta.’
She began trembling all over.
‘Well, here I’ve come to tell you.’
‘Then you really meant it yesterday?’ she whispered with 
difficulty. ‘How do you know?’ she asked quickly, as though Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comsuddenly regaining her reason.
Sonia’s face grew paler and paler, and she breathed pain -
fully.
‘I know.’
She paused a minute.
‘Have they found him?’ she asked timidly.
‘No.’
‘Then how do you know about it?’ she asked again, hardly 
audibly and again after a minute’s pause.
He turned to her and looked very intently at her.
‘Guess,’ he said, with the same distorted helpless smile.
A shudder passed over her.
‘But you … why do you frighten me like this?’ she said, 
smiling like a child.
‘I must be a great friend of his … since I know,’ Raskol -
nikov went on, still gazing into her face, as though he could 
not turn his eyes away. ‘He … did not mean to kill that Liza -
veta … he … killed her accidentally…. He meant to kill the 
old woman when she was alone and he went there … and 
then Lizaveta came in … he killed her too.’
Another awful moment passed. Both still gazed at one 
another.
‘You can’t guess, then?’ he asked suddenly, feeling as 
though he were flinging himself down from a steeple.
‘N-no …’ whispered Sonia.
‘Take a good look.’
As soon as he had said this again, the same familiar 
sensation froze his heart. He looked at her and all at once 
seemed to see in her face the face of Lizaveta. He remem -
Crime and Punishment bered clearly the expression in Lizaveta’s face, when he 
approached her with the axe and she stepped back to the 
wall, putting out her hand, with childish terror in her face, 
looking as little children do when they begin to be fright -
ened of something, looking intently and uneasily at what 
frightens them, shrinking back and holding out their little 
hands on the point of crying. Almost the same thing hap -
pened now to Sonia. With the same helplessness and the 
same terror, she looked at him for a while and, suddenly 
putting out her left hand, pressed her fingers faintly against 
his breast and slowly began to get up from the bed, mov -
ing further from him and keeping her eyes fixed even more 
immovably on him. Her terror infected him. The same fear 
showed itself on his face. In the same way he stared at her 
and almost with the same childish  smile.
‘Have you guessed?’ he whispered at last.
‘Good God!’ broke in an awful wail from her bosom.
She sank helplessly on the bed with her face in the pil -
lows, but a moment later she got up, moved quickly to him, 
seized both his hands and, gripping them tight in her thin 
fingers, began looking into his face again with the same in -
tent stare. In this last desperate look she tried to look into 
him and catch some last hope. But there was no hope; there 
was no doubt remaining; it was all true! Later on, indeed, 
when she recalled that moment, she thought it strange and 
wondered why she had seen at once that there was no doubt. 
She could not have said, for instance, that she had foreseen 
something of the sort—and yet now, as soon as he told her, 
she suddenly fancied that she had really foreseen this very Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comthing.
‘Stop, Sonia, enough! don’t torture me,’ he begged her 
miserably.
It was not at all, not at all like this he had thought of tell -
ing her, but this is how it happened.
She jumped up, seeming not to know what she was do -
ing, and, wringing her hands, walked into the middle of the 
room; but quickly went back and sat down again beside him, 
her shoulder almost touching his. All of a sudden she start -
ed as though she had been stabbed, uttered a cry and fell on 
her knees before him, she did not know why.
‘What have you done—what have you done to yourself?’ 
she said in despair, and, jumping up, she flung herself on 
his neck, threw her arms round him, and held him tightly.
Raskolnikov drew back and looked at her with a mourn -
ful smile.
‘You are a strange girl, Sonia—you kiss me and hug me 
when I tell you about that…. You don’t think what you are 
doing.’
‘There is no one—no one in the whole world now so un -
happy as you!’ she cried in a frenzy, not hearing what he 
said, and she suddenly broke into violent hysterical weep -
ing.
A feeling long unfamiliar to him flooded his heart and 
softened it at once. He did not struggle against it. Two tears 
started into his eyes and hung on his eyelashes.
‘Then you won’t leave me, Sonia?’ he said, looking at her 
almost with hope.
‘No, no, never, nowhere!’ cried Sonia. ‘I will follow you, I
Crime and Punishment will follow you everywhere. Oh, my God! Oh, how misera -
ble I am! … Why, why didn’t I know you before! Why didn’t 
you come before? Oh, dear!’
‘Here I have come.’
‘Yes, now! What’s to be done now? … Together, together!’ 
she repeated as it were unconsciously, and she hugged him 
again. ‘I’ll follow you to Siberia!’
He recoiled at this, and the same hostile, almost haughty 
smile came to his lips.
‘Perhaps I don’t want to go to Siberia yet, Sonia,’ he said.
Sonia looked at him quickly.
Again after her first passionate, agonising sympathy 
for the unhappy man the terrible idea of the murder over -
whelmed her. In his changed tone she seemed to hear the 
murderer speaking. She looked at him bewildered. She 
knew nothing as yet, why, how, with what object it had been. 
Now all these questions rushed at once into her mind. And 
again she could not believe it: ‘He, he is a murderer! Could 
it be true?’
‘What’s the meaning of it? Where am I?’ she said in com -
plete bewilderment, as though still unable to recover herself. 
‘How could you, you, a man like you…. How could you 
bring yourself to it? … What does it mean?’
‘Oh, well—to plunder. Leave off, Sonia,’ he answered 
wearily, almost with vexation.
Sonia stood as though struck dumb, but suddenly she 
cried:
‘You were hungry! It was … to help your mother? Yes?’
‘No, Sonia, no,’ he muttered, turning away and hanging Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comhis head. ‘I was not so hungry…. I certainly did want to help 
my mother, but … that’s not the real thing either…. Don’t 
torture me, Sonia.’
Sonia clasped her hands.
‘Could it, could it all be true? Good God, what a truth! 
Who could believe it? And how could you give away your 
last farthing and yet rob and murder! Ah,’ she cried sud -
denly, ‘that money you gave Katerina Ivanovna … that 
money…. Can that money …’
‘No, Sonia,’ he broke in hurriedly, ‘that money was not 
it. Don’t worry yourself! That money my mother sent me 
and it came when I was ill, the day I gave it to you…. Ra -
zumihin saw it … he received it for me…. That money was 
mine—my own.’
Sonia listened to him in bewilderment and did her ut -
most to comprehend.
‘And that money…. I don’t even know really whether 
there was any money,’ he added softly, as though reflect -
ing. ‘I took a purse off her neck, made of chamois leather … 
a purse stuffed full of something … but I didn’t look in it; I 
suppose I hadn’t time…. And the things—chains and trin -
kets—I buried under a stone with the purse next morning 
in a yard off the V—— Prospect. They are all there now…. .’
Sonia strained every nerve to listen.
‘Then why … why, you said you did it to rob, but you took 
nothing?’ she asked quickly, catching at a straw.
‘I don’t know…. I haven’t yet decided whether to take that 
money or not,’ he said, musing again; and, seeming to wake 
up with a start, he gave a brief ironical smile. ‘Ach, what silly
Crime and Punishment 0stuff I am talking, eh?’
The thought flashed through Sonia’s mind, wasn’t he 
mad? But she dismissed it at once. ‘No, it was something 
else.’ She could make nothing of it, nothing.
‘Do you know, Sonia,’ he said suddenly with conviction, 
‘let me tell you: if I’d simply killed because I was hungry,’ 
laying stress on every word and looking enigmatically but 
sincerely at her, ‘I should be happy  now. You must believe 
that! What would it matter to you,’ he cried a moment later 
with a sort of despair, ‘what would it matter to you if I were 
to confess that I did wrong? What do you gain by such a stu -
pid triumph over me? Ah, Sonia, was it for that I’ve come to 
you to-day?’
Again Sonia tried to say something, but did not speak.
‘I asked you to go with me yesterday because you are all 
I have left.’
‘Go where?’ asked Sonia timidly.
‘Not to steal and not to murder, don’t be anxious,’ he 
smiled bitterly. ‘We are so different…. And you know, So -
nia, it’s only now, only this moment that I understand where  
I asked you to go with me yesterday! Yesterday when I said 
it I did not know where. I asked you for one thing, I came 
to you for one thing—not to leave me. You won’t leave me, 
Sonia?’
She squeezed his hand.
‘And why, why did I tell her? Why did I let her know?’ 
he cried a minute later in despair, looking with infinite 
anguish at her. ‘Here you expect an explanation from me, 
Sonia; you are sitting and waiting for it, I see that. But what Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comcan I tell you? You won’t understand and will only suffer 
misery … on my account! Well, you are crying and embrac -
ing me again. Why do you do it? Because I couldn’t bear my 
burden and have come to throw it on another: you suffer 
too, and I shall feel better! And can you love such a mean 
wretch?’
‘But aren’t you suffering, too?’ cried Sonia.
Again a wave of the same feeling surged into his heart, 
and again for an instant softened it.
‘Sonia, I have a bad heart, take note of that. It may ex -
plain a great deal. I have come because I am bad. There are 
men who wouldn’t have come. But I am a coward and … 
a mean wretch. But … never mind! That’s not the point. I 
must speak now, but I don’t know how to begin.’
He paused and sank into thought.
‘Ach, we are so different,’ he cried again, ‘we are not alike. 
And why, why did I come? I shall never forgive myself that.’
‘No, no, it was a good thing you came,’ cried Sonia. ‘It’s 
better I should know, far better!’
He looked at her with anguish.
‘What if it were really that?’ he said, as though reaching 
a conclusion. ‘Yes, that’s what it was! I wanted to become 
a Napoleon, that is why I killed her…. Do you understand 
now?’
‘N-no,’ Sonia whispered naïvely and timidly. ‘Only speak, 
speak, I shall understand, I shall understand in myself !’ she 
kept begging him.
‘You’ll understand? Very well, we shall see!’ He paused 
and was for some time lost in meditation.
Crime and Punishment ‘It was like this: I asked myself one day this question—
what if Napoleon, for instance, had happened to be in my 
place, and if he had not had Toulon nor Egypt nor the pas -
sage of Mont Blanc to begin his career with, but instead of 
all those picturesque and monumental things, there had 
simply been some ridiculous old hag, a pawnbroker, who 
had to be murdered too to get money from her trunk (for 
his career, you understand). Well, would he have brought 
himself to that if there had been no other means? Wouldn’t 
he have felt a pang at its being so far from monumental and 
… and sinful, too? Well, I must tell you that I worried myself 
fearfully over that ‘question’ so that I was awfully ashamed 
when I guessed at last (all of a sudden, somehow) that it 
would not have given him the least pang, that it would not 
even have struck him that it was not monumental … that he 
would not have seen that there was anything in it to pause 
over, and that, if he had had no other way, he would have 
strangled her in a minute without thinking about it! Well, I 
too … left off thinking about it … murdered her, following 
his example. And that’s exactly how it was! Do you think it 
funny? Yes, Sonia, the funniest thing of all is that perhaps 
that’s just how it was.’
Sonia did not think it at all funny.
‘You had better tell me straight out … without examples,’ 
she begged, still more timidly and scarcely audibly.
He turned to her, looked sadly at her and took her 
hands.
‘You are right again, Sonia. Of course that’s all nonsense, 
it’s almost all talk! You see, you know of course that my Free eBooks at Planet eBook.commother has scarcely anything, my sister happened to have 
a good education and was condemned to drudge as a gov -
erness. All their hopes were centered on me. I was a student, 
but I couldn’t keep myself at the university and was forced 
for a time to leave it. Even if I had lingered on like that, in 
ten or twelve years I might (with luck) hope to be some 
sort of teacher or clerk with a salary of a thousand rou -
bles’ (he repeated it as though it were a lesson) ‘and by that 
time my mother would be worn out with grief and anxiety 
and I could not succeed in keeping her in comfort while 
my sister … well, my sister might well have fared worse! 
And it’s a hard thing to pass everything by all one’s life, to 
turn one’s back upon everything, to forget one’s mother and 
decorously accept the insults inflicted on one’s sister. Why 
should one? When one has buried them to burden oneself 
with others—wife and children—and to leave them again 
without a farthing? So I resolved to gain possession of the 
old woman’s money and to use it for my first years with -
out worrying my mother, to keep myself at the university 
and for a little while after leaving it—and to do this all on 
a broad, thorough scale, so as to build up a completely new 
career and enter upon a new life of independence…. Well … 
that’s all…. Well, of course in killing the old woman I did 
wrong…. Well, that’s enough.’
He struggled to the end of his speech in exhaustion and 
let his head sink.
‘Oh, that’s not it, that’s not it,’ Sonia cried in distress. 
‘How could one … no, that’s not right, not right.’
‘You see yourself that it’s not right. But I’ve spoken truly,
Crime and Punishment it’s the truth.’
‘As though that could be the truth! Good God!’
‘I’ve only killed a louse, Sonia, a useless, loathsome, 
harmful creature.’
‘A human being—a louse!’
‘I too know it wasn’t a louse,’ he answered, looking 
strangely at her. ‘But I am talking nonsense, Sonia,’ he add -
ed. ‘I’ve been talking nonsense a long time…. That’s not it, 
you are right there. There were quite, quite other causes for 
it! I haven’t talked to anyone for so long, Sonia…. My head 
aches dreadfully now.’
His eyes shone with feverish brilliance. He was almost 
delirious; an uneasy smile strayed on his lips. His terrible 
exhaustion could be seen through his excitement. Sonia 
saw how he was suffering. She too was growing dizzy. And 
he talked so strangely; it seemed somehow comprehensible, 
but yet … ‘But how, how! Good God!’ And she wrung her 
hands in despair.
‘No, Sonia, that’s not it,’ he began again suddenly, rais -
ing his head, as though a new and sudden train of thought 
had struck and as it were roused him—‘that’s not it! Bet -
ter … imagine—yes, it’s certainly better—imagine that I 
am vain, envious, malicious, base, vindictive and … well, 
perhaps with a tendency to insanity. (Let’s have it all out at 
once! They’ve talked of madness already, I noticed.) I told 
you just now I could not keep myself at the university. But 
do you know that perhaps I might have done? My mother 
would have sent me what I needed for the fees and I could 
have earned enough for clothes, boots and food, no doubt. Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comLessons had turned up at half a rouble. Razumihin works! 
But I turned sulky and wouldn’t. (Yes, sulkiness, that’s the 
right word for it!) I sat in my room like a spider. You’ve been 
in my den, you’ve seen it…. And do you know, Sonia, that 
low ceilings and tiny rooms cramp the soul and the mind? 
Ah, how I hated that garret! And yet I wouldn’t go out of it! 
I wouldn’t on purpose! I didn’t go out for days together, and 
I wouldn’t work, I wouldn’t even eat, I just lay there doing 
nothing. If Nastasya brought me anything, I ate it, if she 
didn’t, I went all day without; I wouldn’t ask, on purpose, 
from sulkiness! At night I had no light, I lay in the dark and 
I wouldn’t earn money for candles. I ought to have stud -
ied, but I sold my books; and the dust lies an inch thick on 
the notebooks on my table. I preferred lying still and think -
ing. And I kept thinking…. And I had dreams all the time, 
strange dreams of all sorts, no need to describe! Only then 
I began to fancy that … No, that’s not it! Again I am tell -
ing you wrong! You see I kept asking myself then: why am 
I so stupid that if others are stupid—and I know they are—
yet I won’t be wiser? Then I saw, Sonia, that if one waits for 
everyone to get wiser it will take too long…. Afterwards I 
understood that that would never come to pass, that men 
won’t change and that nobody can alter it and that it’s not 
worth wasting effort over it. Yes, that’s so. That’s the law of 
their nature, Sonia, … that’s so! … And I know now, Sonia, 
that whoever is strong in mind and spirit will have power 
over them. Anyone who is greatly daring is right in their 
eyes. He who despises most things will be a lawgiver among 
them and he who dares most of all will be most in the right!
Crime and Punishment So it has been till now and so it will always be. A man must 
be blind not to see it!’
Though Raskolnikov looked at Sonia as he said this, he 
no longer cared whether she understood or not. The fever 
had complete hold of him; he was in a sort of gloomy ecstasy 
(he certainly had been too long without talking to anyone). 
Sonia felt that his gloomy creed had become his faith and 
code.
‘I divined then, Sonia,’ he went on eagerly, ‘that power is 
only vouchsafed to the man who dares to stoop and pick it 
up. There is only one thing, one thing needful: one has only 
to dare! Then for the first time in my life an idea took shape 
in my mind which no one had ever thought of before me, no 
one! I saw clear as daylight how strange it is that not a single 
person living in this mad world has had the daring to go 
straight for it all and send it flying to the devil! I … I wanted 
to have the daring  … and I killed her. I only wanted to have 
the daring, Sonia! That was the whole cause of it!’
‘Oh hush, hush,’ cried Sonia, clasping her hands. ‘You 
turned away from God and God has smitten you, has given 
you over to the devil!’
‘Then Sonia, when I used to lie there in the dark and all 
this became clear to me, was it a temptation of the devil, 
eh?’
‘Hush, don’t laugh, blasphemer! You don’t understand, 
you don’t understand! Oh God! He won’t understand!’
‘Hush, Sonia! I am not laughing. I know myself that it 
was the devil leading me. Hush, Sonia, hush!’ he repeat -
ed with gloomy insistence. ‘I know it all, I have thought it Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comall over and over and whispered it all over to myself, lying 
there in the dark…. I’ve argued it all over with myself, every 
point of it, and I know it all, all! And how sick, how sick I 
was then of going over it all! I have kept wanting to forget 
it and make a new beginning, Sonia, and leave off think -
ing. And you don’t suppose that I went into it headlong like 
a fool? I went into it like a wise man, and that was just my 
destruction. And you mustn’t suppose that I didn’t know, 
for instance, that if I began to question myself whether I 
had the right to gain power—I certainly hadn’t the right—
or that if I asked myself whether a human being is a louse 
it proved that it wasn’t so for me, though it might be for 
a man who would go straight to his goal without asking 
questions…. If I worried myself all those days, wondering 
whether Napoleon would have done it or not, I felt clearly of 
course that I wasn’t Napoleon. I had to endure all the agony 
of that battle of ideas, Sonia, and I longed to throw it off: I 
wanted to murder without casuistry, to murder for my own 
sake, for myself alone! I didn’t want to lie about it even to 
myself. It wasn’t to help my mother I did the murder—that’s 
nonsense —I didn’t do the murder to gain wealth and power 
and to become a benefactor of mankind. Nonsense! I sim -
ply did it; I did the murder for myself, for myself alone, and 
whether I became a benefactor to others, or spent my life 
like a spider catching men in my web and sucking the life 
out of men, I couldn’t have cared at that moment…. And it 
was not the money I wanted, Sonia, when I did it. It was not 
so much the money I wanted, but something else…. I know 
it all now…. Understand me! Perhaps I should never have
Crime and Punishment committed a murder again. I wanted to find out something 
else; it was something else led me on. I wanted to find out 
then and quickly whether I was a louse like everybody else 
or a man. Whether I can step over barriers or not, whether I 
dare stoop to pick up or not, whether I am a trembling crea -
ture or whether I have the right  …’
‘To kill? Have the right to kill?’ Sonia clasped her hands.
‘Ach, Sonia!’ he cried irritably and seemed about to make 
some retort, but was contemptuously silent. ‘Don’t interrupt 
me, Sonia. I want to prove one thing only, that the devil led 
me on then and he has shown me since that I had not the 
right to take that path, because I am just such a louse as 
all the rest. He was mocking me and here I’ve come to you 
now! Welcome your guest! If I were not a louse, should I 
have come to you? Listen: when I went then to the old wom -
an’s I only went to try…. You may be sure of that!’
‘And you murdered her!’
‘But how did I murder her? Is that how men do murders? 
Do men go to commit a murder as I went then? I will tell 
you some day how I went! Did I murder the old woman? I 
murdered myself, not her! I crushed myself once for all, for 
ever…. But it was the devil that killed that old woman, not 
I. Enough, enough, Sonia, enough! Let me be!’ he cried in a 
sudden spasm of agony, ‘let me be!’
He leaned his elbows on his knees and squeezed his head 
in his hands as in a vise.
‘What suffering!’ A wail of anguish broke from Sonia.
‘Well, what am I to do now?’ he asked, suddenly raising 
his head and looking at her with a face hideously distorted Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comby despair.
‘What are you to do?’ she cried, jumping up, and her eyes 
that had been full of tears suddenly began to shine. ‘Stand 
up!’ (She seized him by the shoulder, he got up, looking at 
her almost bewildered.) ‘Go at once, this very minute, stand 
at the cross-roads, bow down, first kiss the earth which you 
have defiled and then bow down to all the world and say to 
all men aloud, ‘I am a murderer!’ Then God will send you 
life again. Will you go, will you go?’ she asked him, trem -
bling all over, snatching his two hands, squeezing them 
tight in hers and gazing at him with eyes full of fire.
He was amazed at her sudden ecstasy.
‘You mean Siberia, Sonia? I must give myself up?’ he 
asked gloomily.
‘Suffer and expiate your sin by it, that’s what you must 
do.’
‘No! I am not going to them, Sonia!’
‘But how will you go on living? What will you live for?’ 
cried Sonia, ‘how is it possible now? Why, how can you talk 
to your mother? (Oh, what will become of them now?) But 
what am I saying? You have abandoned your mother and 
your sister already. He has abandoned them already! Oh, 
God!’ she cried, ‘why, he knows it all himself. How, how can 
he live by himself! What will become of you now?’
‘Don’t be a child, Sonia,’ he said softly. ‘What wrong 
have I done them? Why should I go to them? What should 
I say to them? That’s only a phantom…. They destroy men 
by millions themselves and look on it as a virtue. They are 
knaves and scoundrels, Sonia! I am not going to them. And
Crime and Punishment 0what should I say to them—that I murdered her, but did 
not dare to take the money and hid it under a stone?’ he 
added with a bitter smile. ‘Why, they would laugh at me, 
and would call me a fool for not getting it. A coward and a 
fool! They wouldn’t understand and they don’t deserve to 
understand. Why should I go to them? I won’t. Don’t be a 
child, Sonia….’
‘It will be too much for you to bear, too much!’ she re -
peated, holding out her hands in despairing supplication.
‘Perhaps I’ve been unfair to myself,’ he observed gloom -
ily, pondering, ‘perhaps after all I am a man and not a louse 
and I’ve been in too great a hurry to condemn myself. I’ll 
make another fight for it.’
A haughty smile appeared on his lips.
‘What a burden to bear! And your whole life, your whole 
life!’
‘I shall get used to it,’ he said grimly and thoughtfully. 
‘Listen,’ he began a minute later, ‘stop crying, it’s time to talk 
of the facts: I’ve come to tell you that the police are after me, 
on my track….’
‘Ach!’ Sonia cried in terror.
‘Well, why do you cry out? You want me to go to Sibe -
ria and now you are frightened? But let me tell you: I shall 
not give myself up. I shall make a struggle for it and they 
won’t do anything to me. They’ve no real evidence. Yester -
day I was in great danger and believed I was lost; but to-day 
things are going better. All the facts they know can be ex -
plained two ways, that’s to say I can turn their accusations 
to my credit, do you understand? And I shall, for I’ve learnt Free eBooks at Planet eBook.commy lesson. But they will certainly arrest me. If it had not 
been for something that happened, they would have done so 
to-day for certain; perhaps even now they will arrest me to-
day…. But that’s no matter, Sonia; they’ll let me out again … 
for there isn’t any real proof against me, and there won’t be, 
I give you my word for it. And they can’t convict a man on 
what they have against me. Enough…. I only tell you that 
you may know…. I will try to manage somehow to put it to 
my mother and sister so that they won’t be frightened…. My 
sister’s future is secure, however, now, I believe … and my 
mother’s must be too…. Well, that’s all. Be careful, though. 
Will you come and see me in prison when I am there?’
‘Oh, I will, I will.’
They sat side by side, both mournful and dejected, as 
though they had been cast up by the tempest alone on some 
deserted shore. He looked at Sonia and felt how great was 
her love for him, and strange to say he felt it suddenly bur -
densome and painful to be so loved. Yes, it was a strange 
and awful sensation! On his way to see Sonia he had felt that 
all his hopes rested on her; he expected to be rid of at least 
part of his suffering, and now, when all her heart turned 
towards him, he suddenly felt that he was immeasurably 
unhappier than before.
‘Sonia,’ he said, ‘you’d better not come and see me when 
I am in prison.’
Sonia did not answer, she was crying. Several minutes 
passed.
‘Have you a cross on you?’ she asked, as though suddenly 
thinking of it.
Crime and Punishment He did not at first understand the question.
‘No, of course not. Here, take this one, of cypress wood. 
I have another, a copper one that belonged to Lizaveta. I 
changed with Lizaveta: she gave me her cross and I gave her 
my little ikon. I will wear Lizaveta’s now and give you this. 
Take it … it’s mine! It’s mine, you know,’ she begged him. 
‘We will go to suffer together, and together we will bear our 
cross!’
‘Give it me,’ said Raskolnikov.
He did not want to hurt her feelings. But immediately he 
drew back the hand he held out for the cross.
‘Not now, Sonia. Better later,’ he added to comfort her.
‘Yes, yes, better,’ she repeated with conviction, ‘when you 
go to meet your suffering, then put it on. You will come to 
me, I’ll put it on you, we will pray and go together.’
At that moment someone knocked three times at the 
door.
‘Sofya Semyonovna, may I come in?’ they heard in a very 
familiar and polite voice.
Sonia rushed to the door in a fright. The flaxen head of 
Mr. Lebeziatnikov appeared at the door. Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comChapter V
Lebeziatnikov looked perturbed.
‘I’ve come to you, Sofya Semyonovna,’ he began. ‘Ex -
cuse me … I thought I should find you,’ he said, addressing 
Raskolnikov suddenly, ‘that is, I didn’t mean anything … of 
that sort … But I just thought … Katerina Ivanovna has 
gone out of her mind,’ he blurted out suddenly, turning 
from Raskolnikov to Sonia.
Sonia screamed.
‘At least it seems so. But … we don’t know what to do, 
you see! She came back—she seems to have been turned out 
somewhere, perhaps beaten…. So it seems at least, … She 
had run to your father’s former chief, she didn’t find him at 
home: he was dining at some other general’s…. Only fancy, 
she rushed off there, to the other general’s, and, imagine, she 
was so persistent that she managed to get the chief to see her, 
had him fetched out from dinner, it seems. You can imagine 
what happened. She was turned out, of course; but, accord -
ing to her own story, she abused him and threw something 
at him. One may well believe it…. How it is she wasn’t taken 
up, I can’t understand! Now she is telling everyone, includ -
ing Amalia Ivanovna; but it’s difficult to understand her, 
she is screaming and flinging herself about…. Oh yes, she 
shouts that since everyone has abandoned her, she will take 
the children and go into the street with a barrel-organ, and
Crime and Punishment the children will sing and dance, and she too, and collect 
money, and will go every day under the general’s window 
… ‘to let everyone see well-born children, whose father was 
an official, begging in the street.’ She keeps beating the chil -
dren and they are all crying. She is teaching Lida to sing ‘My 
Village,’ the boy to dance, Polenka the same. She is tearing 
up all the clothes, and making them little caps like actors; 
she means to carry a tin basin and make it tinkle, instead of 
music…. She won’t listen to anything…. Imagine the state 
of things! It’s beyond anything!’
Lebeziatnikov would have gone on, but Sonia, who had 
heard him almost breathless, snatched up her cloak and 
hat, and ran out of the room, putting on her things as she 
went. Raskolnikov followed her and Lebeziatnikov came af -
ter him.
‘She has certainly gone mad!’ he said to Raskolnikov, as 
they went out into the street. ‘I didn’t want to frighten So -
fya Semyonovna, so I said ‘it seemed like it,’ but there isn’t 
a doubt of it. They say that in consumption the tubercles 
sometimes occur in the brain; it’s a pity I know nothing of 
medicine. I did try to persuade her, but she wouldn’t listen.’
‘Did you talk to her about the tubercles?’
‘Not precisely of the tubercles. Besides, she wouldn’t have 
understood! But what I say is, that if you convince a person 
logically that he has nothing to cry about, he’ll stop crying. 
That’s clear. Is it your conviction that he won’t?’
‘Life would be too easy if it were so,’ answered Raskol -
nikov.
‘Excuse me, excuse me; of course it would be rather dif - Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comficult for Katerina Ivanovna to understand, but do you 
know that in Paris they have been conducting serious ex -
periments as to the possibility of curing the insane, simply 
by logical argument? One professor there, a scientific man 
of standing, lately dead, believed in the possibility of such 
treatment. His idea was that there’s nothing really wrong 
with the physical organism of the insane, and that insan -
ity is, so to say, a logical mistake, an error of judgment, an 
incorrect view of things. He gradually showed the madman 
his error and, would you believe it, they say he was success -
ful? But as he made use of douches too, how far success was 
due to that treatment remains uncertain…. So it seems at 
least.’
Raskolnikov had long ceased to listen. Reaching the 
house where he lived, he nodded to Lebeziatnikov and went 
in at the gate. Lebeziatnikov woke up with a start, looked 
about him and hurried on.
Raskolnikov went into his little room and stood still in 
the middle of it. Why had he come back here? He looked 
at the yellow and tattered paper, at the dust, at his sofa…. 
From the yard came a loud continuous knocking; someone 
seemed to be hammering … He went to the window, rose 
on tiptoe and looked out into the yard for a long time with 
an air of absorbed attention. But the yard was empty and 
he could not see who was hammering. In the house on the 
left he saw some open windows; on the window-sills were 
pots of sickly-looking geraniums. Linen was hung out of 
the windows … He knew it all by heart. He turned away 
and sat down on the sofa.
Crime and Punishment Never, never had he felt himself so fearfully alone!
Yes, he felt once more that he would perhaps come to 
hate Sonia, now that he had made her more miserable.
‘Why had he gone to her to beg for her tears? What need 
had he to poison her life? Oh, the meanness of it!’
‘I will remain alone,’ he said resolutely, ‘and she shall not 
come to the prison!’
Five minutes later he raised his head with a strange smile. 
That was a strange thought.
‘Perhaps it really would be better in Siberia,’ he thought 
suddenly.
He could not have said how long he sat there with vague 
thoughts surging through his mind. All at once the door 
opened and Dounia came in. At first she stood still and 
looked at him from the doorway, just as he had done at So -
nia; then she came in and sat down in the same place as 
yesterday, on the chair facing him. He looked silently and 
almost vacantly at her.
‘Don’t be angry, brother; I’ve only come for one minute,’ 
said Dounia.
Her face looked thoughtful but not stern. Her eyes were 
bright and soft. He saw that she too had come to him with 
love.
‘Brother, now I know all, all. Dmitri Prokofitch has ex -
plained and told me everything. They are worrying and 
persecuting you through a stupid and contemptible suspi -
cion…. Dmitri Prokofitch told me that there is no danger, 
and that you are wrong in looking upon it with such horror. 
I don’t think so, and I fully understand how indignant you Free eBooks at Planet eBook.commust be, and that that indignation may have a permanent 
effect on you. That’s what I am afraid of. As for your cutting 
yourself off from us, I don’t judge you, I don’t venture to 
judge you, and forgive me for having blamed you for it. I feel 
that I too, if I had so great a trouble, should keep away from 
everyone. I shall tell mother nothing of this  but I shall talk 
about you continually and shall tell her from you that you 
will come very soon. Don’t worry about her; I will set her 
mind at rest; but don’t you try her too much—come once 
at least; remember that she is your mother. And now I have 
come simply to say’ (Dounia began to get up) ‘that if you 
should need me or should need … all my life or anything … 
call me, and I’ll come. Good-bye!’
She turned abruptly and went towards the door.
‘Dounia!’ Raskolnikov stopped her and went towards her. 
‘That Razumihin, Dmitri Prokofitch, is a very good fellow.’
Dounia flushed slightly.
‘Well?’ she asked, waiting a moment.
‘He is competent, hardworking, honest and capable of 
real love…. Good-bye, Dounia.’
Dounia flushed crimson, then suddenly she took alarm.
‘But what does it mean, brother? Are we really parting for 
ever that you … give me such a parting message?’
‘Never mind…. Good-bye.’
He turned away, and walked to the window. She stood a 
moment, looked at him uneasily, and went out troubled.
No, he was not cold to her. There was an instant (the very 
last one) when he had longed to take her in his arms and say 
good-bye  to her, and even to tell  her, but he had not dared
Crime and Punishment even to touch her hand.
‘Afterwards she may shudder when she remembers that I 
embraced her, and will feel that I stole her kiss.’
‘And would she stand that test?’ he went on a few minutes 
later to himself. ‘No, she wouldn’t; girls like that can’t stand 
things! They never do.’
And he thought of Sonia.
There was a breath of fresh air from the window. The 
daylight was fading. He took up his cap and went out.
He could not, of course, and would not consider how ill 
he was. But all this continual anxiety and agony of mind 
could not but affect him. And if he were not lying in high 
fever it was perhaps just because this continual inner strain 
helped to keep him on his legs and in possession of his fac -
ulties. But this artificial excitement could not last long.
He wandered aimlessly. The sun was setting. A special 
form of misery had begun to oppress him of late. There was 
nothing poignant, nothing acute about it; but there was a 
feeling of permanence, of eternity about it; it brought a fore -
taste of hopeless years of this cold leaden misery, a foretaste 
of an eternity ‘on a square yard of space.’ Towards evening 
this sensation usually began to weigh on him more heavily.
‘With this idiotic, purely physical weakness, depending 
on the sunset or something, one can’t help doing something 
stupid! You’ll go to Dounia, as well as to Sonia,’ he muttered 
bitterly.
He heard his name called. He looked round. Lebeziat -
nikov rushed up to him.
‘Only fancy, I’ve been to your room looking for you. Only Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comfancy, she’s carried out her plan, and taken away the chil -
dren. Sofya Semyonovna and I have had a job to find them. 
She is rapping on a frying-pan and making the children 
dance. The children are crying. They keep stopping at the 
cross-roads and in front of shops; there’s a crowd of fools 
running after them. Come along!’
‘And Sonia?’ Raskolnikov asked anxiously, hurrying after 
Lebeziatnikov.
‘Simply frantic. That is, it’s not Sofya Semyonovna’s 
frantic, but Katerina Ivanovna, though Sofya Semyonova’s 
frantic too. But Katerina Ivanovna is absolutely frantic. I tell 
you she is quite mad. They’ll be taken to the police. You can 
fancy what an effect that will have…. They are on the canal 
bank, near the bridge now, not far from Sofya Semyonov -
na’s, quite close.’
On the canal bank near the bridge and not two houses 
away from the one where Sonia lodged, there was a crowd of 
people, consisting principally of gutter children. The hoarse 
broken voice of Katerina Ivanovna could be heard from the 
bridge, and it certainly was a strange spectacle likely to at -
tract a street crowd. Katerina Ivanovna in her old dress with 
the green shawl, wearing a torn straw hat, crushed in a hid -
eous way on one side, was really frantic. She was exhausted 
and breathless. Her wasted consumptive face looked more 
suffering than ever, and indeed out of doors in the sunshine 
a consumptive always looks worse than at home. But her ex -
citement did not flag, and every moment her irritation grew 
more intense. She rushed at the children, shouted at them, 
coaxed them, told them before the crowd how to dance and
Crime and Punishment 00what to sing, began explaining to them why it was neces -
sary, and driven to desperation by their not understanding, 
beat them…. Then she would make a rush at the crowd; if 
she noticed any decently dressed person stopping to look, 
she immediately appealed to him to see what these children 
‘from a genteel, one may say aristocratic, house’ had been 
brought to. If she heard laughter or jeering in the crowd, 
she would rush at once at the scoffers and begin squabbling 
with them. Some people laughed, others shook their heads, 
but everyone felt curious at the sight of the madwoman 
with the frightened children. The frying-pan of which Le -
beziatnikov had spoken was not there, at least Raskolnikov 
did not see it. But instead of rapping on the pan, Katerina 
Ivanovna began clapping her wasted hands, when she made 
Lida and Kolya dance and Polenka sing. She too joined in 
the singing, but broke down at the second note with a fear -
ful cough, which made her curse in despair and even shed 
tears. What made her most furious was the weeping and ter -
ror of Kolya and Lida. Some effort had been made to dress 
the children up as street singers are dressed. The boy had 
on a turban made of something red and white to look like a 
Turk. There had been no costume for Lida; she simply had a 
red knitted cap, or rather a night cap that had belonged to 
Marmeladov, decorated with a broken piece of white ostrich 
feather, which had been Katerina Ivanovna’s grandmother’s 
and had been preserved as a family possession. Polenka was 
in her everyday dress; she looked in timid perplexity at her 
mother, and kept at her side, hiding her tears. She dimly 
realised her mother’s condition, and looked uneasily about
01 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comher. She was terribly frightened of the street and the crowd. 
Sonia followed Katerina Ivanovna, weeping and beseech -
ing her to return home, but Katerina Ivanovna was not to 
be persuaded.
‘Leave off, Sonia, leave off,’ she shouted, speaking fast, 
panting and coughing. ‘You don’t know what you ask; you 
are like a child! I’ve told you before that I am not coming 
back to that drunken German. Let everyone, let all Pe -
tersburg see the children begging in the streets, though 
their father was an honourable man who served all his life 
in truth and fidelity, and one may say died in the service.’ 
(Katerina Ivanovna had by now invented this fantastic story 
and thoroughly believed it.) ‘Let that wretch of a general see 
it! And you are silly, Sonia: what have we to eat? Tell me that. 
We have worried you enough, I won’t go on so! Ah, Rodi -
on Romanovitch, is that you?’ she cried, seeing Raskolnikov 
and rushing up to him. ‘Explain to this silly girl, please, that 
nothing better could be done! Even organ-grinders earn 
their living, and everyone will see at once that we are differ -
ent, that we are an honourable and bereaved family reduced 
to beggary. And that general will lose his post, you’ll see! 
We shall perform under his windows every day, and if the 
Tsar drives by, I’ll fall on my knees, put the children before 
me, show them to him, and say ‘Defend us father.’ He is 
the father of the fatherless, he is merciful, he’ll protect us, 
you’ll see, and that wretch of a general…. Lida, tenez vous 
droite ! Kolya, you’ll dance again. Why are you whimpering? 
Whimpering again! What are you afraid of, stupid? Good -
ness, what am I to do with them, Rodion Romanovitch? If
Crime and Punishment 0you only knew how stupid they are! What’s one to do with 
such children?’
And she, almost crying herself—which did not stop her 
uninterrupted, rapid flow of talk—pointed to the crying 
children. Raskolnikov tried to persuade her to go home, 
and even said, hoping to work on her vanity, that it was 
unseemly for her to be wandering about the streets like an 
organ-grinder, as she was intending to become the princi -
pal of a boarding-school.
‘A boarding-school, ha-ha-ha! A castle in the air,’ cried 
Katerina Ivanovna, her laugh ending in a cough. ‘No, Ro -
dion Romanovitch, that dream is over! All have forsaken 
us! … And that general…. You know, Rodion Romanovitch, 
I threw an inkpot at him—it happened to be standing in 
the waiting-room by the paper where you sign your name. 
I wrote my name, threw it at him and ran away. Oh, the 
scoundrels, the scoundrels! But enough of them, now I’ll 
provide for the children myself, I won’t bow down to any -
body! She has had to bear enough for us!’ she pointed to 
Sonia. ‘Polenka, how much have you got? Show me! What, 
only two farthings! Oh, the mean wretches! They give us

yes, … What are we to sing? You keep putting me out, but 
we … you see, we are standing here, Rodion Romanovitch, 
to find something to sing and get money, something Kolya 
can dance to…. For, as you can fancy, our performance is 
all impromptu…. We must talk it over and rehearse it all 
thoroughly, and then we shall go to Nevsky, where there are 
far more people of good society, and we shall be noticed at 
once. Lida knows ‘My Village’ only, nothing but ‘My Village,’ 
and everyone sings that. We must sing something far more 
genteel…. Well, have you thought of anything, Polenka? If 
only you’d help your mother! My memory’s quite gone, or I 
should have thought of something. We really can’t sing ‘An 
Hussar.’ Ah, let us sing in French, ‘Cinq sous,’ I have taught 
it you, I have taught it you. And as it is in French, people 
will see at once that you are children of good family, and 
that will be much more touching…. You might sing ‘Marl -

and is sung as a lullaby in all the aristocratic houses.
‘Marlborough s’en va-t-en guerre Ne sait quand reviendra

she began singing. ‘But no, better sing ‘Cinq sous.’ Now, 
Kolya, your hands on your hips, make haste, and you, Lida, 
keep turning the other way, and Polenka and I will sing and 
clap our hands!
‘Cinq sous, cinq sous Pour monter notre menage. ’

from coughing. ‘Now it’s particularly necessary to behave

‘A policeman again! What do you want?’
A policeman was indeed forcing his way through the 
crowd. But at that moment a gentleman in civilian uniform 
and an overcoat—a solid- looking official of about fifty with 
a decoration on his neck (which delighted Katerina Ivanov -
na and had its effect on the policeman)— approached and 
without a word handed her a green three-rouble note. His 
face wore a look of genuine sympathy. Katerina Ivanovna 
took it and gave him a polite, even ceremonious, bow.
‘I thank you, honoured sir,’ she began loftily. ‘The causes 
that have induced us (take the money, Polenka: you see there 
are generous and honourable people who are ready to help a 
poor gentlewoman in distress). You see, honoured sir, these 
orphans of good family—I might even say of aristocratic 
connections—and that wretch of a general sat eating grouse 
… and stamped at my disturbing him. ‘Your excellency,’ I 
said, ‘protect the orphans, for you knew my late husband, 
Semyon Zaharovitch, and on the very day of his death the 
basest of scoundrels slandered his only daughter.’ … That 
policeman again! Protect me,’ she cried to the official. ‘Why 
is that policeman edging up to me? We have only just run

‘It’s forbidden in the streets. You mustn’t make a distur -
bance.’
‘It’s you’re making a disturbance. It’s just the same as if I 
were grinding an organ. What business is it of yours?’
‘You have to get a licence for an organ, and you haven’t 
got one, and in that way you collect a crowd. Where do you 
lodge?’
‘What, a license?’ wailed Katerina Ivanovna. ‘I buried my 
husband to-day. What need of a license?’
‘Calm yourself, madam, calm yourself,’ began the official. 
‘Come along; I will escort you…. This is no place for you in 
the crowd. You are ill.’
‘Honoured sir, honoured sir, you don’t know,’ screamed 
Katerina Ivanovna. ‘We are going to the Nevsky…. Sonia, 
Sonia! Where is she? She is crying too! What’s the matter 
with you all? Kolya, Lida, where are you going?’ she cried 
suddenly in alarm. ‘Oh, silly children! Kolya, Lida, where 
are they off to? …’
Kolya and Lida, scared out of their wits by the crowd, 
and their mother’s mad pranks, suddenly seized each oth -
er by the hand, and ran off at the sight of the policeman 
who wanted to take them away somewhere. Weeping and 
wailing, poor Katerina Ivanovna ran after them. She was 
a piteous and unseemly spectacle, as she ran, weeping and 
panting for breath. Sonia and Polenka rushed after them.
‘Bring them back, bring them back, Sonia! Oh stupid, 
ungrateful children! … Polenka! catch them…. It’s for your 
sakes I …’
Crime and Punishment 0She stumbled as she ran and fell down.
‘She’s cut herself, she’s bleeding! Oh, dear!’ cried Sonia, 
bending over her.
All ran up and crowded around. Raskolnikov and Leb -
eziatnikov were the first at her side, the official too hastened 
up, and behind him the policeman who muttered, ‘Bother!’ 
with a gesture of impatience, feeling that the job was going 
to be a troublesome one.
‘Pass on! Pass on!’ he said to the crowd that pressed for -
ward.
‘She’s dying,’ someone shouted.
‘She’s gone out of her mind,’ said another.
‘Lord have mercy upon us,’ said a woman, crossing her -
self. ‘Have they caught the little girl and the boy? They’re 
being brought back, the elder one’s got them…. Ah, the 
naughty imps!’
When they examined Katerina Ivanovna carefully, they 
saw that she had not cut herself against a stone, as Sonia 
thought, but that the blood that stained the pavement red 
was from her chest.
‘I’ve seen that before,’ muttered the official to Raskol -
nikov and Lebeziatnikov; ‘that’s consumption; the blood 
flows and chokes the patient. I saw the same thing with a 
relative of my own not long ago … nearly a pint of blood, all 
in a minute…. What’s to be done though? She is dying.’
‘This way, this way, to my room!’ Sonia implored. ‘I live 
here! … See, that house, the second from here…. Come to 
me, make haste,’ she turned from one to the other. ‘Send for 
the doctor! Oh, dear!’
0 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comThanks to the official’s efforts, this plan was adopted, the 
policeman even helping to carry Katerina Ivanovna. She 
was carried to Sonia’s room, almost unconscious, and laid 
on the bed. The blood was still flowing, but she seemed to 
be coming to herself. Raskolnikov, Lebeziatnikov, and the 
official accompanied Sonia into the room and were followed 
by the policeman, who first drove back the crowd which fol -
lowed to the very door. Polenka came in holding Kolya and 
Lida, who were trembling and weeping. Several persons 
came in too from the Kapernaumovs’ room; the landlord, 
a lame one-eyed man of strange appearance with whis -
kers and hair that stood up like a brush, his wife, a woman 
with an everlastingly scared expression, and several open-
mouthed children with wonder-struck faces. Among these, 
Svidrigaïlov suddenly made his appearance. Raskolnikov 
looked at him with surprise, not understanding where he 
had come from and not having noticed him in the crowd. 
A doctor and priest wore spoken of. The official whispered 
to Raskolnikov that he thought it was too late now for the 
doctor, but he ordered him to be sent for. Kapernaumov ran 
himself.
Meanwhile Katerina Ivanovna had regained her breath. 
The bleeding ceased for a time. She looked with sick but 
intent and penetrating eyes at Sonia, who stood pale and 
trembling, wiping the sweat from her brow with a handker -
chief. At last she asked to be raised. They sat her up on the 
bed, supporting her on both sides.
‘Where are the children?’ she said in a faint voice. ‘You’ve 
brought them, Polenka? Oh the sillies! Why did you run
Crime and Punishment 0away…. Och!’
Once more her parched lips were covered with blood. 
She moved her eyes, looking about her.
‘So that’s how you live, Sonia! Never once have I been in 
your room.’
She looked at her with a face of suffering.
‘We have been your ruin, Sonia. Polenka, Lida, Kolya, 
come here! Well, here they are, Sonia, take them all! I hand 
them over to you, I’ve had enough! The ball is over.’ (Cough!) 
‘Lay me down, let me die in peace.’
They laid her back on the pillow.
‘What, the priest? I don’t want him. You haven’t got a 
rouble to spare. I have no sins. God must forgive me with -
out that. He knows how I have suffered…. And if He won’t 
forgive me, I don’t care!’
She sank more and more into uneasy delirium. At times 
she shuddered, turned her eyes from side to side, recog -
nised everyone for a minute, but at once sank into delirium 
again. Her breathing was hoarse and difficult, there was a 
sort of rattle in her throat.
‘I said to him, your excellency,’ she ejaculated, gasping 
after each word. ‘That Amalia Ludwigovna, ah! Lida, Kolya, 
hands on your hips, make haste! Glissez, glissez! pas de 
basque!  Tap with your heels, be a graceful child!
‘Du hast Diamanten und Perlen

‘In the heat of midday in the vale of Dagestan.
‘Ah, how I loved it! I loved that song to distraction, Po -
lenka! Your father, you know, used to sing it when we were 
engaged…. Oh those days! Oh that’s the thing for us to sing! 
How does it go? I’ve forgotten. Remind me! How was it?’
She was violently excited and tried to sit up. At last, in 
a horribly hoarse, broken voice, she began, shrieking and 
gasping at every word, with a look of growing terror.
‘In the heat of midday! … in the vale! … of Dagestan! … 
With lead in my breast! …’
‘Your excellency!’ she wailed suddenly with a heart-rend -
ing scream and a flood of tears, ‘protect the orphans! You 
have been their father’s guest … one may say aristocratic….’ 
She started, regaining consciousness, and gazed at all with 
a sort of terror, but at once recognised Sonia.
‘Sonia, Sonia!’ she articulated softly and caressingly, as 
though surprised to find her there. ‘Sonia darling, are you 
here, too?’
They lifted her up again.
‘Enough! It’s over! Farewell, poor thing! I am done for! I 
am broken!’ she cried with vindictive despair, and her head 
fell heavily back on the pillow.
She sank into unconsciousness again, but this time it did 
not last long. Her pale, yellow, wasted face dropped back, 
her mouth fell open, her leg moved convulsively, she gave a 
deep, deep sigh and died.
Sonia fell upon her, flung her arms about her, and re -
mained motionless with her head pressed to the dead
Crime and Punishment 10woman’s wasted bosom. Polenka threw herself at her moth -
er’s feet, kissing them and weeping violently. Though Kolya 
and Lida did not understand what had happened, they had 
a feeling that it was something terrible; they put their hands 
on each other’s little shoulders, stared straight at one an -
other and both at once opened their mouths and began 
screaming. They were both still in their fancy dress; one in 
a turban, the other in the cap with the ostrich feather.
And how did ‘the certificate of merit’ come to be on the 
bed beside Katerina Ivanovna? It lay there by the pillow; 
Raskolnikov saw it.
He walked away to the window. Lebeziatnikov skipped 
up to him.
‘She is dead,’ he said.
‘Rodion Romanovitch, I must have two words with you,’ 
said Svidrigaïlov, coming up to them.
Lebeziatnikov at once made room for him and delicately 
withdrew. Svidrigaïlov drew Raskolnikov further away.
‘I will undertake all the arrangements, the funeral and 
that. You know it’s a question of money and, as I told you, 
I have plenty to spare. I will put those two little ones and 
Polenka into some good orphan asylum, and I will settle 
fifteen hundred roubles to be paid to each on coming of 
age, so that Sofya Semyonovna need have no anxiety about 
them. And I will pull her out of the mud too, for she is a 
good girl, isn’t she? So tell Avdotya Romanovna that that is 
how I am spending her ten thousand.’
‘What is your motive for such benevolence?’ asked Ras -
kolnikov.
11 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com‘Ah! you sceptical person!’ laughed Svidrigaïlov. ‘I told 
you I had no need of that money. Won’t you admit that it’s 
simply done from humanity? She wasn’t ‘a louse,’ you know’ 
(he pointed to the corner where the dead woman lay), ‘was 
she, like some old pawnbroker woman? Come, you’ll agree, 
is Luzhin to go on living, and doing wicked things or is 
she to die? And if I didn’t help them, Polenka would go the 
same way.’
He said this with an air of a sort of gay winking slyness, 
keeping his eyes fixed on Raskolnikov, who turned white 
and cold, hearing his own phrases, spoken to Sonia. He 
quickly stepped back and looked wildly at Svidrigaïlov.
‘How do you know?’ he whispered, hardly able to 
breathe.
‘Why, I lodge here at Madame Resslich’s, the other side 
of the wall. Here is Kapernaumov, and there lives Madame 
Resslich, an old and devoted friend of mine. I am a neigh -
bour.’
‘You?’
‘Yes,’ continued Svidrigaïlov, shaking with laughter. ‘I 
assure you on my honour, dear Rodion Romanovitch, that 
you have interested me enormously. I told you we should 
become friends, I foretold it. Well, here we have. And you 
will see what an accommodating person I am. You’ll see 
that you can get on with me!’
Crime and Punishment 1Part VI
1 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comChapter I
A strange period began for Raskolnikov: it was as though 
a fog had fallen upon him and wrapped him in a dreary 
solitude from which there was no escape. Recalling that pe -
riod long after, he believed that his mind had been clouded 
at times, and that it had continued so, with intervals, till 
the final catastrophe. He was convinced that he had been 
mistaken about many things at that time, for instance as to 
the date of certain events. Anyway, when he tried later on to 
piece his recollections together, he learnt a great deal about 
himself from what other people told him. He had mixed up 
incidents and had explained events as due to circumstanc -
es which existed only in his imagination. At times he was 
a prey to agonies of morbid uneasiness, amounting some -
times to panic. But he remembered, too, moments, hours, 
perhaps whole days, of complete apathy, which came upon 
him as a reaction from his previous terror and might be 
compared with the abnormal insensibility, sometimes seen 
in the dying. He seemed to be trying in that latter stage to 
escape from a full and clear understanding of his position. 
Certain essential facts which required immediate consider -
ation were particularly irksome to him. How glad he would 
have been to be free from some cares, the neglect of which 
would have threatened him with complete, inevitable ruin.
He was particularly worried about Svidrigaïlov, he might
Crime and Punishment 1be said to be permanently thinking of Svidrigaïlov. From 
the time of Svidrigaïlov’s too menacing and unmistakable 
words in Sonia’s room at the moment of Katerina Ivanov -
na’s death, the normal working of his mind seemed to break 
down. But although this new fact caused him extreme un -
easiness, Raskolnikov was in no hurry for an explanation 
of it. At times, finding himself in a solitary and remote part 
of the town, in some wretched eating-house, sitting alone 
lost in thought, hardly knowing how he had come there, he 
suddenly thought of Svidrigaïlov. He recognised suddenly, 
clearly, and with dismay that he ought at once to come to an 
understanding with that man and to make what terms he 
could. Walking outside the city gates one day, he positive -
ly fancied that they had fixed a meeting there, that he was 
waiting for Svidrigaïlov. Another time he woke up before 
daybreak lying on the ground under some bushes and could 
not at first understand how he had come there.
But during the two or three days after Katerina Ivanov -
na’s death, he had two or three times met Svidrigaïlov at 
Sonia’s lodging, where he had gone aimlessly for a moment. 
They exchanged a few words and made no reference to the 
vital subject, as though they were tacitly agreed not to speak 
of it for a time.
Katerina Ivanovna’s body was still lying in the coffin, 
Svidrigaïlov was busy making arrangements for the funeral. 
Sonia too was very busy. At their last meeting Svidrigaïlov 
informed Raskolnikov that he had made an arrangement, 
and a very satisfactory one, for Katerina Ivanovna’s chil -
dren; that he had, through certain connections, succeeded
1 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comin getting hold of certain personages by whose help the 
three orphans could be at once placed in very suitable insti -
tutions; that the money he had settled on them had been of 
great assistance, as it is much easier to place orphans with 
some property than destitute ones. He said something too 
about Sonia and promised to come himself in a day or two 
to see Raskolnikov, mentioning that ‘he would like to con -
sult with him, that there were things they must talk over….’
This conversation took place in the passage on the stairs. 
Svidrigaïlov looked intently at Raskolnikov and suddenly, 
after a brief pause, dropping his voice, asked: ‘But how is 
it, Rodion Romanovitch; you don’t seem yourself? You look 
and you listen, but you don’t seem to understand. Cheer up! 
We’ll talk things over; I am only sorry, I’ve so much to do 
of my own business and other people’s. Ah, Rodion Roma -
novitch,’ he added suddenly, ‘what all men need is fresh air, 
fresh air … more than anything!’
He moved to one side to make way for the priest and 
server, who were coming up the stairs. They had come for 
the requiem service. By Svidrigaïlov’s orders it was sung 
twice a day punctually. Svidrigaïlov went his way. Raskol -
nikov stood still a moment, thought, and followed the priest 
into Sonia’s room. He stood at the door. They began quietly, 
slowly and mournfully singing the service. From his child -
hood the thought of death and the presence of death had 
something oppressive and mysteriously awful; and it was 
long since he had heard the requiem service. And there was 
something else here as well, too awful and disturbing. He 
looked at the children: they were all kneeling by the cof -
Crime and Punishment 1fin; Polenka was weeping. Behind them Sonia prayed, softly 
and, as it were, timidly weeping.
‘These last two days she hasn’t said a word to me, she 
hasn’t glanced at me,’ Raskolnikov thought suddenly. The 
sunlight was bright in the room; the incense rose in clouds; 
the priest read, ‘Give rest, oh Lord….’ Raskolnikov stayed 
all through the service. As he blessed them and took his 
leave, the priest looked round strangely. After the service, 
Raskolnikov went up to Sonia. She took both his hands and 
let her head sink on his shoulder. This slight friendly ges -
ture bewildered Raskolnikov. It seemed strange to him that 
there was no trace of repugnance, no trace of disgust, no 
tremor in her hand. It was the furthest limit of self-abnega -
tion, at least so he interpreted it.
Sonia said nothing. Raskolnikov pressed her hand and 
went out. He felt very miserable. If it had been possible to 
escape to some solitude, he would have thought himself 
lucky, even if he had to spend his whole life there. But al -
though he had almost always been by himself of late, he 
had never been able to feel alone. Sometimes he walked out 
of the town on to the high road, once he had even reached 
a little wood, but the lonelier the place was, the more he 
seemed to be aware of an uneasy presence near him. It did 
not frighten him, but greatly annoyed him, so that he made 
haste to return to the town, to mingle with the crowd, to 
enter restaurants and taverns, to walk in busy thorough -
fares. There he felt easier and even more solitary. One day 
at dusk he sat for an hour listening to songs in a tavern and 
he remembered that he positively enjoyed it. But at last he
1 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comhad suddenly felt the same uneasiness again, as though his 
conscience smote him. ‘Here I sit listening to singing, is that 
what I ought to be doing?’ he thought. Yet he felt at once 
that that was not the only cause of his uneasiness; there was 
something requiring immediate decision, but it was some -
thing he could not clearly understand or put into words. It 
was a hopeless tangle. ‘No, better the struggle again! Better 
Porfiry again … or Svidrigaïlov…. Better some challenge 
again … some attack. Yes, yes!’ he thought. He went out of 
the tavern and rushed away almost at a run. The thought of 
Dounia and his mother suddenly reduced him almost to a 
panic. That night he woke up before morning among some 
bushes in Krestovsky Island, trembling all over with fever; 
he walked home, and it was early morning when he arrived. 
After some hours’ sleep the fever left him, but he woke up 
late, two o’clock in the afternoon.
He remembered that Katerina Ivanovna’s funeral had 
been fixed for that day, and was glad that he was not pres -
ent at it. Nastasya brought him some food; he ate and drank 
with appetite, almost with greediness. His head was fresh -
er and he was calmer than he had been for the last three 
days. He even felt a passing wonder at his previous attacks 
of panic.
The door opened and Razumihin came in.
‘Ah, he’s eating, then he’s not ill,’ said Razumihin. He took 
a chair and sat down at the table opposite Raskolnikov.
He was troubled and did not attempt to conceal it. He 
spoke with evident annoyance, but without hurry or rais -
ing his voice. He looked as though he had some special fixed
Crime and Punishment 1determination.
‘Listen,’ he began resolutely. ‘As far as I am concerned, 
you may all go to hell, but from what I see, it’s clear to me 
that I can’t make head or tail of it; please don’t think I’ve 
come to ask you questions. I don’t want to know, hang it! If 
you begin telling me your secrets, I dare say I shouldn’t stay 
to listen, I should go away cursing. I have only come to find 
out once for all whether it’s a fact that you are mad? There 
is a conviction in the air that you are mad or very nearly so. 
I admit I’ve been disposed to that opinion myself, judging 
from your stupid, repulsive and quite inexplicable actions, 
and from your recent behavior to your mother and sister. 
Only a monster or a madman could treat them as you have; 
so you must be mad.’
‘When did you see them last?’
‘Just now. Haven’t you seen them since then? What have 
you been doing with yourself? Tell me, please. I’ve been to 
you three times already. Your mother has been seriously ill 
since yesterday. She had made up her mind to come to you; 
Avdotya Romanovna tried to prevent her; she wouldn’t hear 
a word. ‘If he is ill, if his mind is giving way, who can look af -
ter him like his mother?’ she said. We all came here together, 
we couldn’t let her come alone all the way. We kept begging 
her to be calm. We came in, you weren’t here; she sat down, 
and stayed ten minutes, while we stood waiting in silence. 
She got up and said: ‘If he’s gone out, that is, if he is well, and 
has forgotten his mother, it’s humiliating and unseemly for 
his mother to stand at his door begging for kindness.’ She 
returned home and took to her bed; now she is in a fever. ‘I
1 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comsee,’ she said, ‘that he has time for his girl . ‘ She means by 
your girl  Sofya Semyonovna, your betrothed or your mis -
tress, I don’t know. I went at once to Sofya Semyonovna’s, 
for I wanted to know what was going on. I looked round, I 
saw the coffin, the children crying, and Sofya Semyonovna 
trying them on mourning dresses. No sign of you. I apol -
ogised, came away, and reported to Avdotya Romanovna. 
So that’s all nonsense and you haven’t got a girl; the most 
likely thing is that you are mad. But here you sit, guzzling 
boiled beef as though you’d not had a bite for three days. 
Though as far as that goes, madmen eat too, but though you 
have not said a word to me yet … you are not mad! That I’d 
swear! Above all, you are not mad! So you may go to hell, all 
of you, for there’s some mystery, some secret about it, and 
I don’t intend to worry my brains over your secrets. So I’ve 
simply come to swear at you,’ he finished, getting up, ‘to re -
lieve my mind. And I know what to do now.’
‘What do you mean to do now?’
‘What business is it of yours what I mean to do?’
‘You are going in for a drinking bout.’
‘How … how did you know?’
‘Why, it’s pretty plain.’
Razumihin paused for a minute.
‘You always have been a very rational person and you’ve 
never been mad, never,’ he observed suddenly with warmth. 
‘You’re right: I shall drink. Good-bye!’
And he moved to go out.
‘I was talking with my sister—the day before yesterday, I 
think it was—about you, Razumihin.’
Crime and Punishment 0‘About me! But … where can you have seen her the day 
before yesterday?’ Razumihin stopped short and even 
turned a little pale.
One could see that his heart was throbbing slowly and 
violently.
‘She came here by herself, sat there and talked to me.’
‘She did!’
‘Yes.’
‘What did you say to her … I mean, about me?’
‘I told her you were a very good, honest, and industrious 
man. I didn’t tell her you love her, because she knows that 
herself.’
‘She knows that herself?’
‘Well, it’s pretty plain. Wherever I might go, whatever 
happened to me, you would remain to look after them. I, 
so to speak, give them into your keeping, Razumihin. I say 
this because I know quite well how you love her, and am 
convinced of the purity of your heart. I know that she too 
may love you and perhaps does love you already. Now de -
cide for yourself, as you know best, whether you need go in 
for a drinking bout or not.’
‘Rodya! You see … well…. Ach, damn it! But where do 
you mean to go? Of course, if it’s all a secret, never mind…. 
But I … I shall find out the secret … and I am sure that it 
must be some ridiculous nonsense and that you’ve made it 
all up. Anyway you are a capital fellow, a capital fellow! …’
‘That was just what I wanted to add, only you interrupted, 
that that was a very good decision of yours not to find out 
these secrets. Leave it to time, don’t worry about it. You’ll Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comknow it all in time when it must be. Yesterday a man said 
to me that what a man needs is fresh air, fresh air, fresh air. 
I mean to go to him directly to find out what he meant by 
that.’
Razumihin stood lost in thought and excitement, mak -
ing a silent conclusion.
‘He’s a political conspirator! He must be. And he’s on 
the eve of some desperate step, that’s certain. It can only be 
that! And … and Dounia knows,’ he thought suddenly.
‘So Avdotya Romanovna comes to see you,’ he said, 
weighing each syllable, ‘and you’re going to see a man who 
says we need more air, and so of course that letter … that 
too must have something to do with it,’ he concluded to 
himself.
‘What letter?’
‘She got a letter to-day. It upset her very much—very 
much indeed. Too much so. I began speaking of you, she 
begged me not to. Then … then she said that perhaps we 
should very soon have to part … then she began warmly 
thanking me for something; then she went to her room and 
locked herself in.’
‘She got a letter?’ Raskolnikov asked thoughtfully.
‘Yes, and you didn’t know? hm …’
They were both silent.
‘Good-bye, Rodion. There was a time, brother, when I…. 
Never mind, good-bye. You see, there was a time…. Well, 
good-bye! I must be off too. I am not going to drink. There’s 
no need now…. That’s all stuff!’
He hurried out; but when he had almost closed the door
Crime and Punishment behind him, he suddenly opened it again, and said, look -
ing away:
‘Oh, by the way, do you remember that murder, you know 
Porfiry’s, that old woman? Do you know the murderer has 
been found, he has confessed and given the proofs. It’s one 
of those very workmen, the painter, only fancy! Do you re -
member I defended them here? Would you believe it, all 
that scene of fighting and laughing with his companions on 
the stairs while the porter and the two witnesses were going 
up, he got up on purpose to disarm suspicion. The cunning, 
the presence of mind of the young dog! One can hardly 
credit it; but it’s his own explanation, he has confessed it all. 
And what a fool I was about it! Well, he’s simply a genius 
of hypocrisy and resourcefulness in disarming the suspi -
cions of the lawyers—so there’s nothing much to wonder 
at, I suppose! Of course people like that are always possible. 
And the fact that he couldn’t keep up the character, but con -
fessed, makes him easier to believe in. But what a fool I was! 
I was frantic on their side!’
‘Tell me, please, from whom did you hear that, and why 
does it interest you so?’ Raskolnikov asked with unmistak -
able agitation.
‘What next? You ask me why it interests me! … Well, I 
heard it from Porfiry, among others … It was from him I 
heard almost all about it.’
‘From Porfiry?’
‘From Porfiry.’
‘What … what did he say?’ Raskolnikov asked in dismay.
‘He gave me a capital explanation of it. Psychologically, Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comafter his fashion.’
‘He explained it? Explained it himself?’
‘Yes, yes; good-bye. I’ll tell you all about it another time, 
but now I’m busy. There was a time when I fancied … But 
no matter, another time! … What need is there for me to 
drink now? You have made me drunk without wine. I am 
drunk, Rodya! Good-bye, I’m going. I’ll come again very 
soon.’
He went out.
‘He’s a political conspirator, there’s not a doubt about 
it,’ Razumihin decided, as he slowly descended the stairs. 
‘And he’s drawn his sister in; that’s quite, quite in keeping 
with Avdotya Romanovna’s character. There are interviews 
between them! … She hinted at it too … So many of her 
words…. and hints … bear that meaning! And how else can 
all this tangle be explained? Hm! And I was almost think -
ing … Good heavens, what I thought! Yes, I took leave of my 
senses and I wronged him! It was his doing, under the lamp 
in the corridor that day. Pfoo! What a crude, nasty, vile idea 
on my part! Nikolay is a brick, for confessing…. And how 
clear it all is now! His illness then, all his strange actions 
… before this, in the university, how morose he used to be, 
how gloomy…. But what’s the meaning now of that letter? 
There’s something in that, too, perhaps. Whom was it from? 
I suspect …! No, I must find out!’
He thought of Dounia, realising all he had heard and his 
heart throbbed, and he suddenly broke into a run.
As soon as Razumihin went out, Raskolnikov got up, 
turned to the window, walked into one corner and then into
Crime and Punishment another, as though forgetting the smallness of his room, and 
sat down again on the sofa. He felt, so to speak, renewed; 
again the struggle, so a means of escape had come.
‘Yes, a means of escape had come! It had been too sti -
fling, too cramping, the burden had been too agonising. A 
lethargy had come upon him at times. From the moment of 
the scene with Nikolay at Porfiry’s he had been suffocating, 
penned in without hope of escape. After Nikolay’s confes -
sion, on that very day had come the scene with Sonia; his 
behaviour and his last words had been utterly unlike any -
thing he could have imagined beforehand; he had grown 
feebler, instantly and fundamentally! And he had agreed at 
the time with Sonia, he had agreed in his heart he could not 
go on living alone with such a thing on his mind!
‘And Svidrigaïlov was a riddle … He worried him, that 
was true, but somehow not on the same point. He might 
still have a struggle to come with Svidrigaïlov. Svidrigaïlov, 
too, might be a means of escape; but Porfiry was a different 
matter.
‘And so Porfiry himself had explained it to Razumihin, 
had explained it psychologically . He had begun bringing in 
his damned psychology again! Porfiry? But to think that 
Porfiry should for one moment believe that Nikolay was 
guilty, after what had passed between them before Nikolay’s 
appearance, after that tête-à-tête interview, which could 
have only one explanation? (During those days Raskolnikov 
had often recalled passages in that scene with Porfiry; he 
could not bear to let his mind rest on it.) Such words, such 
gestures had passed between them, they had exchanged Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comsuch glances, things had been said in such a tone and had 
reached such a pass, that Nikolay, whom Porfiry had seen 
through at the first word, at the first gesture, could not have 
shaken his conviction.
‘And to think that even Razumihin had begun to suspect! 
The scene in the corridor under the lamp had produced its 
effect then. He had rushed to Porfiry…. But what had in -
duced the latter to receive him like that? What had been 
his object in putting Razumihin off with Nikolay? He must 
have some plan; there was some design, but what was it? It 
was true that a long time had passed since that morning—
too long a time—and no sight nor sound of Porfiry. Well, 
that was a bad sign….’
Raskolnikov took his cap and went out of the room, still 
pondering. It was the first time for a long while that he had 
felt clear in his mind, at least. ‘I must settle Svidrigaïlov,’ he 
thought, ‘and as soon as possible; he, too, seems to be wait -
ing for me to come to him of my own accord.’ And at that 
moment there was such a rush of hate in his weary heart 
that he might have killed either of those two—Porfiry or 
Svidrigaïlov. At least he felt that he would be capable of do -
ing it later, if not now.
‘We shall see, we shall see,’ he repeated to himself.
But no sooner had he opened the door than he stumbled 
upon Porfiry himself in the passage. He was coming in to 
see him. Raskolnikov was dumbfounded for a minute, but 
only for one minute. Strange to say, he was not very much 
astonished at seeing Porfiry and scarcely afraid of him. He 
was simply startled, but was quickly, instantly, on his guard.
Crime and Punishment ‘Perhaps this will mean the end? But how could Porfiry have 
approached so quietly, like a cat, so that he had heard noth -
ing? Could he have been listening at the door?’
‘You didn’t expect a visitor, Rodion Romanovitch,’ Por -
firy explained, laughing. ‘I’ve been meaning to look in a 
long time; I was passing by and thought why not go in for 
five minutes. Are you going out? I won’t keep you long. Just 
let me have one cigarette.’
‘Sit down, Porfiry Petrovitch, sit down.’ Raskolnikov gave 
his visitor a seat with so pleased and friendly an expression 
that he would have marvelled at himself, if he could have 
seen it.
The last moment had come, the last drops had to be 
drained! So a man will sometimes go through half an hour 
of mortal terror with a brigand, yet when the knife is at his 
throat at last, he feels no fear.
Raskolnikov seated himself directly facing Porfiry, and 
looked at him without flinching. Porfiry screwed up his 
eyes and began lighting a cigarette.
‘Speak, speak,’ seemed as though it would burst from 
Raskolnikov’s heart. ‘Come, why don’t you speak?’ Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comChapter II
‘Ah these cigarettes!’ Porfiry Petrovitch ejaculated at last, 
having lighted one. ‘They are pernicious, positively perni -
cious, and yet I can’t give them up! I cough, I begin to have 
tickling in my throat and a difficulty in breathing. You know 
I am a coward, I went lately to Dr. B——n; he always gives 
at least half an hour to each patient. He positively laughed 
looking at me; he sounded me: ‘Tobacco’s bad for you,’ he 
said, ‘your lungs are affected.’ But how am I to give it up? 
What is there to take its place? I don’t drink, that’s the mis -
chief, he-he-he, that I don’t. Everything is relative, Rodion 
Romanovitch, everything is relative!’
‘Why, he’s playing his professional tricks again,’ Raskol -
nikov thought with disgust. All the circumstances of their 
last interview suddenly came back to him, and he felt a rush 
of the feeling that had come upon him then.
‘I came to see you the day before yesterday, in the eve -
ning; you didn’t know?’ Porfiry Petrovitch went on, looking 
round the room. ‘I came into this very room. I was passing 
by, just as I did to-day, and I thought I’d return your call. 
I walked in as your door was wide open, I looked round, 
waited and went out without leaving my name with your 
servant. Don’t you lock your door?’
Raskolnikov’s face grew more and more gloomy. Porfiry 
seemed to guess his state of mind.
Crime and Punishment ‘I’ve come to have it out with you, Rodion Romanovitch, 
my dear fellow! I owe you an explanation and must give it 
to you,’ he continued with a slight smile, just patting Ras -
kolnikov’s knee.
But almost at the same instant a serious and careworn 
look came into his face; to his surprise Raskolnikov saw a 
touch of sadness in it. He had never seen and never suspect -
ed such an expression in his face.
‘A strange scene passed between us last time we met, Ro -
dion Romanovitch. Our first interview, too, was a strange 
one; but then … and one thing after another! This is the 
point: I have perhaps acted unfairly to you; I feel it. Do you 
remember how we parted? Your nerves were unhinged and 
your knees were shaking and so were mine. And, you know, 
our behaviour was unseemly, even ungentlemanly. And yet 
we are gentlemen, above all, in any case, gentlemen; that 
must be understood. Do you remember what we came to? … 
and it was quite indecorous.’
‘What is he up to, what does he take me for?’ Raskolnikov 
asked himself in amazement, raising his head and looking 
with open eyes on Porfiry.
‘I’ve decided openness is better between us,’ Porfiry 
Petrovitch went on, turning his head away and dropping 
his eyes, as though unwilling to disconcert his former vic -
tim and as though disdaining his former wiles. ‘Yes, such 
suspicions and such scenes cannot continue for long. Niko -
lay put a stop to it, or I don’t know what we might not have 
come to. That damned workman was sitting at the time in 
the next room—can you realise that? You know that, of Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comcourse; and I am aware that he came to you afterwards. But 
what you supposed then was not true: I had not sent for any -
one, I had made no kind of arrangements. You ask why I 
hadn’t? What shall I say to you? it had all come upon me so 
suddenly. I had scarcely sent for the porters (you noticed 
them as you went out, I dare say). An idea flashed upon me; 
I was firmly convinced at the time, you see, Rodion Roma -
novitch. Come, I thought—even if I let one thing slip for a 
time, I shall get hold of something else—I shan’t lose what 
I want, anyway. You are nervously irritable, Rodion Roma -
novitch, by temperament; it’s out of proportion with other 
qualities of your heart and character, which I flatter myself 
I have to some extent divined. Of course I did reflect even 
then that it does not always happen that a man gets up and 
blurts out his whole story. It does happen sometimes, if you 
make a man lose all patience, though even then it’s rare. I 
was capable of realising that. If I only had a fact, I thought, 
the least little fact to go upon, something I could lay hold 
of, something tangible, not merely psychological. For if a 
man is guilty, you must be able to get something substantial 
out of him; one may reckon upon most surprising results 
indeed. I was reckoning on your temperament, Rodion Ro -
manovitch, on your temperament above all things! I had 
great hopes of you at that time.’
‘But what are you driving at now?’ Raskolnikov muttered 
at last, asking the question without thinking.
‘What is he talking about?’ he wondered distractedly, 
‘does he really take me to be innocent?’
‘What am I driving at? I’ve come to explain myself, I con -
Crime and Punishment 0sider it my duty, so to speak. I want to make clear to you how 
the whole business, the whole misunderstanding arose. I’ve 
caused you a great deal of suffering, Rodion Romanovitch. 
I am not a monster. I understand what it must mean for a 
man who has been unfortunate, but who is proud, imperi -
ous and above all, impatient, to have to bear such treatment! 
I regard you in any case as a man of noble character and 
not without elements of magnanimity, though I don’t agree 
with all your convictions. I wanted to tell you this first, 
frankly and quite sincerely, for above all I don’t want to de -
ceive you. When I made your acquaintance, I felt attracted 
by you. Perhaps you will laugh at my saying so. You have a 
right to. I know you disliked me from the first and indeed 
you’ve no reason to like me. You may think what you like, 
but I desire now to do all I can to efface that impression and 
to show that I am a man of heart and conscience. I speak 
sincerely.’
Porfiry Petrovitch made a dignified pause. Raskolnikov 
felt a rush of renewed alarm. The thought that Porfiry be -
lieved him to be innocent began to make him uneasy.
‘It’s scarcely necessary to go over everything in detail,’ 
Porfiry Petrovitch went on. ‘Indeed, I could scarcely attempt 
it. To begin with there were rumours. Through whom, how, 
and when those rumours came to me … and how they af -
fected you, I need not go into. My suspicions were aroused 
by a complete accident, which might just as easily not have 
happened. What was it? Hm! I believe there is no need to 
go into that either. Those rumours and that accident led to 
one idea in my mind. I admit it openly—for one may as well Free eBooks at Planet eBook.commake a clean breast of it—I was the first to pitch on you. The 
old woman’s notes on the pledges and the rest of it—that all 
came to nothing. Yours was one of a hundred. I happened, 
too, to hear of the scene at the office, from a man who de -
scribed it capitally, unconsciously reproducing the scene 
with great vividness. It was just one thing after another, Ro -
dion Romanovitch, my dear fellow! How could I avoid being 
brought to certain ideas? From a hundred rabbits you can’t 
make a horse, a hundred suspicions don’t make a proof, as 
the English proverb says, but that’s only from the rational 
point of view—you can’t help being partial, for after all a 
lawyer is only human. I thought, too, of your article in that 
journal, do you remember, on your first visit we talked of 
it? I jeered at you at the time, but that was only to lead you 
on. I repeat, Rodion Romanovitch, you are ill and impatient. 
That you were bold, headstrong, in earnest and … had felt a 
great deal I recognised long before. I, too, have felt the same, 
so that your article seemed familiar to me. It was conceived 
on sleepless nights, with a throbbing heart, in ecstasy and 
suppressed enthusiasm. And that proud suppressed enthu -
siasm in young people is dangerous! I jeered at you then, 
but let me tell you that, as a literary amateur, I am awfully 
fond of such first essays, full of the heat of youth. There is 
a mistiness and a chord vibrating in the mist. Your article 
is absurd and fantastic, but there’s a transparent sincerity, a 
youthful incorruptible pride and the daring of despair in it. 
It’s a gloomy article, but that’s what’s fine in it. I read your 
article and put it aside, thinking as I did so ‘that man won’t 
go the common way.’ Well, I ask you, after that as a prelimi -
Crime and Punishment nary, how could I help being carried away by what followed? 
Oh, dear, I am not saying anything, I am not making any 
statement now. I simply noted it at the time. What is there 
in it? I reflected. There’s nothing in it, that is really noth -
ing and perhaps absolutely nothing. And it’s not at all the 
thing for the prosecutor to let himself be carried away by 
notions: here I have Nikolay on my hands with actual evi -
dence against him—you may think what you like of it, but 
it’s evidence. He brings in his psychology, too; one has to 
consider him, too, for it’s a matter of life and death. Why 
am I explaining this to you? That you may understand, and 
not blame my malicious behaviour on that occasion. It was 
not malicious, I assure you, he-he! Do you suppose I didn’t 
come to search your room at the time? I did, I did, he-he! I 
was here when you were lying ill in bed, not officially, not in 
my own person, but I was here. Your room was searched to 
the last thread at the first suspicion; but umsonst ! I thought 
to myself, now that man will come, will come of himself 
and quickly, too; if he’s guilty, he’s sure to come. Anoth -
er man wouldn’t, but he will. And you remember how Mr. 
Razumihin began discussing the subject with you? We ar -
ranged that to excite you, so we purposely spread rumours, 
that he might discuss the case with you, and Razumihin 
is not a man to restrain his indignation. Mr. Zametov was 
tremendously struck by your anger and your open daring. 
Think of blurting out in a restaurant ‘I killed her.’ It was too 
daring, too reckless. I thought so myself, if he is guilty he 
will be a formidable opponent. That was what I thought at 
the time. I was expecting you. But you simply bowled Za - Free eBooks at Planet eBook.commetov over and … well, you see, it all lies in this—that this 
damnable psychology can be taken two ways! Well, I kept 
expecting you, and so it was, you came! My heart was fairly 
throbbing. Ach!
‘Now, why need you have come? Your laughter, too, as 
you came in, do you remember? I saw it all plain as daylight, 
but if I hadn’t expected you so specially, I should not have 
noticed anything in your laughter. You see what influence a 
mood has! Mr. Razumihin then—ah, that stone, that stone 
under which the things were hidden! I seem to see it some -
where in a kitchen garden. It was in a kitchen garden, you 
told Zametov and afterwards you repeated that in my office? 
And when we began picking your article to pieces, how you 
explained it! One could take every word of yours in two 
senses, as though there were another meaning hidden.
‘So in this way, Rodion Romanovitch, I reached the fur -
thest limit, and knocking my head against a post, I pulled 
myself up, asking myself what I was about. After all, I said, 
you can take it all in another sense if you like, and it’s more 
natural so, indeed. I couldn’t help admitting it was more 
natural. I was bothered! ‘No, I’d better get hold of some lit -
tle fact’ I said. So when I heard of the bell-ringing, I held 
my breath and was all in a tremor. ‘Here is my little fact,’ 
thought I, and I didn’t think it over, I simply wouldn’t. I 
would have given a thousand roubles at that minute to have 
seen you with my own eyes, when you walked a hundred 
paces beside that workman, after he had called you murder -
er to your face, and you did not dare to ask him a question 
all the way. And then what about your trembling, what
Crime and Punishment about your bell-ringing in your illness, in semi-delirium?
‘And so, Rodion Romanovitch, can you wonder that I 
played such pranks on you? And what made you come at 
that very minute? Someone seemed to have sent you, by Jove! 
And if Nikolay had not parted us … and do you remember 
Nikolay at the time? Do you remember him clearly? It was 
a thunderbolt, a regular thunderbolt! And how I met him! 
I didn’t believe in the thunderbolt, not for a minute. You 
could see it for yourself; and how could I? Even afterwards, 
when you had gone and he began making very, very plausi -
ble answers on certain points, so that I was surprised at him 
myself, even then I didn’t believe his story! You see what it 
is to be as firm as a rock! No, thought I, Morgenfrüh . What 
has Nikolay got to do with it!’
‘Razumihin told me just now that you think Nikolay 
guilty and had yourself assured him of it….’
His voice failed him, and he broke off. He had been lis -
tening in indescribable agitation, as this man who had seen 
through and through him, went back upon himself. He was 
afraid of believing it and did not believe it. In those still am -
biguous words he kept eagerly looking for something more 
definite and conclusive.
‘Mr. Razumihin!’ cried Porfiry Petrovitch, seeming glad 
of a question from Raskolnikov, who had till then been si -
lent. ‘He-he-he! But I had to put Mr. Razumihin off; two 
is company, three is none. Mr. Razumihin is not the right 
man, besides he is an outsider. He came running to me with 
a pale face…. But never mind him, why bring him in? To 
return to Nikolay, would you like to know what sort of a Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comtype he is, how I understand him, that is? To begin with, he 
is still a child and not exactly a coward, but something by 
way of an artist. Really, don’t laugh at my describing him so. 
He is innocent and responsive to influence. He has a heart, 
and is a fantastic fellow. He sings and dances, he tells sto -
ries, they say, so that people come from other villages to 
hear him. He attends school too, and laughs till he cries if 
you hold up a finger to him; he will drink himself sense -
less—not as a regular vice, but at times, when people treat 
him, like a child. And he stole, too, then, without knowing 
it himself, for ‘How can it be stealing, if one picks it up?’ 
And do you know he is an Old Believer, or rather a dissent -
er? There have been Wanderers[*] in his family, and he was 
for two years in his village under the spiritual guidance of 
a certain elder. I learnt all this from Nikolay and from his 
fellow villagers. And what’s more, he wanted to run into the 
wilderness! He was full of fervour, prayed at night, read the 
old books, ‘the true’ ones, and read himself crazy.
[*] A religious sect.—TRANSLATOR’S NOTE.
‘Petersburg had a great effect upon him, especially the 
women and the wine. He responds to everything and he for -
got the elder and all that. I learnt that an artist here took 
a fancy to him, and used to go and see him, and now this 
business came upon him.
‘Well, he was frightened, he tried to hang himself! He 
ran away! How can one get over the idea the people have of 
Russian legal proceedings? The very word ‘trial’ frightens 
some of them. Whose fault is it? We shall see what the new 
juries will do. God grant they do good! Well, in prison, it
Crime and Punishment seems, he remembered the venerable elder; the Bible, too, 
made its appearance again. Do you know, Rodion Romano -
vitch, the force of the word ‘suffering’ among some of these 
people! It’s not a question of suffering for someone’s benefit, 
but simply, ‘one must suffer.’ If they suffer at the hands of 
the authorities, so much the better. In my time there was 
a very meek and mild prisoner who spent a whole year in 
prison always reading his Bible on the stove at night and 
he read himself crazy, and so crazy, do you know, that one 
day, apropos of nothing, he seized a brick and flung it at the 
governor; though he had done him no harm. And the way 
he threw it too: aimed it a yard on one side on purpose, for 
fear of hurting him. Well, we know what happens to a pris -
oner who assaults an officer with a weapon. So ‘he took his 
suffering.’
‘So I suspect now that Nikolay wants to take his suffer -
ing or something of the sort. I know it for certain from 
facts, indeed. Only he doesn’t know that I know. What, you 
don’t admit that there are such fantastic people among the 
peasants? Lots of them. The elder now has begun influenc -
ing him, especially since he tried to hang himself. But he’ll 
come and tell me all himself. You think he’ll hold out? Wait 
a bit, he’ll take his words back. I am waiting from hour to 
hour for him to come and abjure his evidence. I have come 
to like that Nikolay and am studying him in detail. And 
what do you think? He-he! He answered me very plausibly 
on some points, he obviously had collected some evidence 
and prepared himself cleverly. But on other points he is 
simply at sea, knows nothing and doesn’t even suspect that Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comhe doesn’t know!
‘No, Rodion Romanovitch, Nikolay doesn’t come in! 
This is a fantastic, gloomy business, a modern case, an in -
cident of to-day when the heart of man is troubled, when 
the phrase is quoted that blood ‘renews,’ when comfort is 
preached as the aim of life. Here we have bookish dreams, 
a heart unhinged by theories. Here we see resolution in the 
first stage, but resolution of a special kind: he resolved to 
do it like jumping over a precipice or from a bell tower and 
his legs shook as he went to the crime. He forgot to shut 
the door after him, and murdered two people for a theo -
ry. He committed the murder and couldn’t take the money, 
and what he did manage to snatch up he hid under a stone. 
It wasn’t enough for him to suffer agony behind the door 
while they battered at the door and rung the bell, no, he had 
to go to the empty lodging, half delirious, to recall the bell-
ringing, he wanted to feel the cold shiver over again…. Well, 
that we grant, was through illness, but consider this: he is 
a murderer, but looks upon himself as an honest man, de -
spises others, poses as injured innocence. No, that’s not the 
work of a Nikolay, my dear Rodion Romanovitch!’
All that had been said before had sounded so like a recan -
tation that these words were too great a shock. Raskolnikov 
shuddered as though he had been stabbed.
‘Then … who then … is the murderer?’ he asked in a 
breathless voice, unable to restrain himself.
Porfiry Petrovitch sank back in his chair, as though he 
were amazed at the question.
‘Who is the murderer?’ he repeated, as though unable to
Crime and Punishment believe his ears. ‘Why, you Rodion Romanovitch! You are 
the murderer,’ he added, almost in a whisper, in a voice of 
genuine conviction.
Raskolnikov leapt from the sofa, stood up for a few sec -
onds and sat down again without uttering a word. His face 
twitched convulsively.
‘Your lip is twitching just as it did before,’ Porfiry Petro -
vitch observed almost sympathetically. ‘You’ve been 
misunderstanding me, I think, Rodion Romanovitch,’ he 
added after a brief pause, ‘that’s why you are so surprised. 
I came on purpose to tell you everything and deal openly 
with you.’
‘It was not I murdered her,’ Raskolnikov whispered like a 
frightened child caught in the act.
‘No, it was you, you Rodion Romanovitch, and no one 
else,’ Porfiry whispered sternly, with conviction.
They were both silent and the silence lasted strangely 
long, about ten minutes. Raskolnikov put his elbow on the 
table and passed his fingers through his hair. Porfiry Petro -
vitch sat quietly waiting. Suddenly Raskolnikov looked 
scornfully at Porfiry.
‘You are at your old tricks again, Porfiry Petrovitch! Your 
old method again. I wonder you don’t get sick of it!’
‘Oh, stop that, what does that matter now? It would be a 
different matter if there were witnesses present, but we are 
whispering alone. You see yourself that I have not come to 
chase and capture you like a hare. Whether you confess it 
or not is nothing to me now; for myself, I am convinced 
without it.’ Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com‘If so, what did you come for?’ Raskolnikov asked irrita -
bly. ‘I ask you the same question again: if you consider me 
guilty, why don’t you take me to prison?’
‘Oh, that’s your question! I will answer you, point for 
point. In the first place, to arrest you so directly is not to 
my interest.’
‘How so? If you are convinced you ought….’
‘Ach, what if I am convinced? That’s only my dream for 
the time. Why should I put you in safety? You know that’s it, 
since you ask me to do it. If I confront you with that work -
man for instance and you say to him ‘were you drunk or 
not? Who saw me with you? I simply took you to be drunk, 
and you were drunk, too.’ Well, what could I answer, espe -
cially as your story is a more likely one than his? for there’s 
nothing but psychology to support his evidence—that’s al -
most unseemly with his ugly mug, while you hit the mark 
exactly, for the rascal is an inveterate drunkard and notori -
ously so. And I have myself admitted candidly several times 
already that that psychology can be taken in two ways and 
that the second way is stronger and looks far more prob -
able, and that apart from that I have as yet nothing against 
you. And though I shall put you in prison and indeed have 
come—quite contrary to etiquette—to inform you of it be -
forehand, yet I tell you frankly, also contrary to etiquette, 
that it won’t be to my advantage. Well, secondly, I’ve come 
to you because …’
‘Yes, yes, secondly?’ Raskolnikov was listening breath -
less.
‘Because, as I told you just now, I consider I owe you an
Crime and Punishment 0explanation. I don’t want you to look upon me as a monster, 
as I have a genuine liking for you, you may believe me or 
not. And in the third place I’ve come to you with a direct 
and open proposition—that you should surrender and con -
fess. It will be infinitely more to your advantage and to my 
advantage too, for my task will be done. Well, is this open 
on my part or not?’
Raskolnikov thought a minute.
‘Listen, Porfiry Petrovitch. You said just now you have 
nothing but psychology to go on, yet now you’ve gone 
on mathematics. Well, what if you are mistaken yourself, 
now?’
‘No, Rodion Romanovitch, I am not mistaken. I have a 
little fact even then, Providence sent it me.’
‘What little fact?’
‘I won’t tell you what, Rodion Romanovitch. And in any 
case, I haven’t the right to put it off any longer, I must arrest 
you. So think it over: it makes no difference to me now and 
so I speak only for your sake. Believe me, it will be better, 
Rodion Romanovitch.’
Raskolnikov smiled malignantly.
‘That’s not simply ridiculous, it’s positively shameless. 
Why, even if I were guilty, which I don’t admit, what reason 
should I have to confess, when you tell me yourself that I 
shall be in greater safety in prison?’
‘Ah, Rodion Romanovitch, don’t put too much faith in 
words, perhaps prison will not be altogether a restful place. 
That’s only theory and my theory, and what authority am 
I for you? Perhaps, too, even now I am hiding something Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comfrom you? I can’t lay bare everything, he-he! And how can 
you ask what advantage? Don’t you know how it would less -
en your sentence? You would be confessing at a moment 
when another man has taken the crime on himself and so 
has muddled the whole case. Consider that! I swear before 
God that I will so arrange that your confession shall come 
as a complete surprise. We will make a clean sweep of all 
these psychological points, of a suspicion against you, so 
that your crime will appear to have been something like an 
aberration, for in truth it was an aberration. I am an honest 
man, Rodion Romanovitch, and will keep my word.’
Raskolnikov maintained a mournful silence and let his 
head sink dejectedly. He pondered a long while and at last 
smiled again, but his smile was sad and gentle.
‘No!’ he said, apparently abandoning all attempt to keep 
up appearances with Porfiry, ‘it’s not worth it, I don’t care 
about lessening the sentence!’
‘That’s just what I was afraid of!’ Porfiry cried warmly 
and, as it seemed, involuntarily. ‘That’s just what I feared, 
that you wouldn’t care about the mitigation of sentence.’
Raskolnikov looked sadly and expressively at him.
‘Ah, don’t disdain life!’ Porfiry went on. ‘You have a great 
deal of it still before you. How can you say you don’t want a 
mitigation of sentence? You are an impatient fellow!’
‘A great deal of what lies before me?’
‘Of life. What sort of prophet are you, do you know much 
about it? Seek and ye shall find. This may be God’s means 
for bringing you to Him. And it’s not for ever, the bond -
age….’
Crime and Punishment ‘The time will be shortened,’ laughed Raskolnikov.
‘Why, is it the bourgeois disgrace you are afraid of? It 
may be that you are afraid of it without knowing it, because 
you are young! But anyway you shouldn’t be afraid of giving 
yourself up and confessing.’
‘Ach, hang it!’ Raskolnikov whispered with loathing and 
contempt, as though he did not want to speak aloud.
He got up again as though he meant to go away, but sat 
down again in evident despair.
‘Hang it, if you like! You’ve lost faith and you think that 
I am grossly flattering you; but how long has your life been? 
How much do you understand? You made up a theory and 
then were ashamed that it broke down and turned out to be 
not at all original! It turned out something base, that’s true, 
but you are not hopelessly base. By no means so base! At 
least you didn’t deceive yourself for long, you went straight 
to the furthest point at one bound. How do I regard you? I 
regard you as one of those men who would stand and smile 
at their torturer while he cuts their entrails out, if only they 
have found faith or God. Find it and you will live. You have 
long needed a change of air. Suffering, too, is a good thing. 
Suffer! Maybe Nikolay is right in wanting to suffer. I know 
you don’t believe in it—but don’t be over-wise; fling yourself 
straight into life, without deliberation; don’t be afraid—the 
flood will bear you to the bank and set you safe on your 
feet again. What bank? How can I tell? I only believe that 
you have long life before you. I know that you take all my 
words now for a set speech prepared beforehand, but maybe 
you will remember them after. They may be of use some Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comtime. That’s why I speak. It’s as well that you only killed 
the old woman. If you’d invented another theory you might 
perhaps have done something a thousand times more hid -
eous. You ought to thank God, perhaps. How do you know? 
Perhaps God is saving you for something. But keep a good 
heart and have less fear! Are you afraid of the great expia -
tion before you? No, it would be shameful to be afraid of 
it. Since you have taken such a step, you must harden your 
heart. There is justice in it. You must fulfil the demands of 
justice. I know that you don’t believe it, but indeed, life will 
bring you through. You will live it down in time. What you 
need now is fresh air, fresh air, fresh air!’
Raskolnikov positively started.
‘But who are you? what prophet are you? From the height 
of what majestic calm do you proclaim these words of wis -
dom?’
‘Who am I? I am a man with nothing to hope for, that’s 
all. A man perhaps of feeling and sympathy, maybe of some 
knowledge too, but my day is over. But you are a different 
matter, there is life waiting for you. Though, who knows? 
maybe your life, too, will pass off in smoke and come to 
nothing. Come, what does it matter, that you will pass into 
another class of men? It’s not comfort you regret, with your 
heart! What of it that perhaps no one will see you for so 
long? It’s not time, but yourself that will decide that. Be the 
sun and all will see you. The sun has before all to be the sun. 
Why are you smiling again? At my being such a Schiller? I 
bet you’re imagining that I am trying to get round you by 
flattery. Well, perhaps I am, he-he-he! Perhaps you’d better
Crime and Punishment not believe my word, perhaps you’d better never believe it 
altogether—I’m made that way, I confess it. But let me add, 
you can judge for yourself, I think, how far I am a base sort 
of man and how far I am honest.’
‘When do you mean to arrest me?’
‘Well, I can let you walk about another day or two. Think 
it over, my dear fellow, and pray to God. It’s more in your 
interest, believe me.’
‘And what if I run away?’ asked Raskolnikov with a 
strange smile.
‘No, you won’t run away. A peasant would run away, a 
fashionable dissenter would run away, the flunkey of anoth -
er man’s thought, for you’ve only to show him the end of 
your little finger and he’ll be ready to believe in anything for 
the rest of his life. But you’ve ceased to believe in your the -
ory already, what will you run away with? And what would 
you do in hiding? It would be hateful and difficult for you, 
and what you need more than anything in life is a definite 
position, an atmosphere to suit you. And what sort of atmo -
sphere would you have? If you ran away, you’d come back 
to yourself. You can’t get on without us.  And if I put you in 
prison—say you’ve been there a month, or two, or three—
remember my word, you’ll confess of yourself and perhaps 
to your own surprise. You won’t know an hour beforehand 
that you are coming with a confession. I am convinced that 
you will decide, ‘to take your suffering.’ You don’t believe 
my words now, but you’ll come to it of yourself. For suf -
fering, Rodion Romanovitch, is a great thing. Never mind 
my having grown fat, I know all the same. Don’t laugh at it, Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comthere’s an idea in suffering, Nokolay is right. No, you won’t 
run away, Rodion Romanovitch.’
Raskolnikov got up and took his cap. Porfiry Petrovitch 
also rose.
‘Are you going for a walk? The evening will be fine, if only 
we don’t have a storm. Though it would be a good thing to 
freshen the air.’
He, too, took his cap.
‘Porfiry Petrovitch, please don’t take up the notion that 
I have confessed to you to-day,’ Raskolnikov pronounced 
with sullen insistence. ‘You’re a strange man and I have 
listened to you from simple curiosity. But I have admitted 
nothing, remember that!’
‘Oh, I know that, I’ll remember. Look at him, he’s trem -
bling! Don’t be uneasy, my dear fellow, have it your own way. 
Walk about a bit, you won’t be able to walk too far. If any -
thing happens, I have one request to make of you,’ he added, 
dropping his voice. ‘It’s an awkward one, but important. If 
anything were to happen (though indeed I don’t believe in 
it and think you quite incapable of it), yet in case you were 
taken during these forty or fifty hours with the notion of 
putting an end to the business in some other way, in some 
fantastic fashion—laying hands on yourself—(it’s an absurd 
proposition, but you must forgive me for it) do leave a brief 
but precise note, only two lines, and mention the stone. It 
will be more generous. Come, till we meet! Good thoughts 
and sound decisions to you!’
Porfiry went out, stooping and avoiding looking at Ras -
kolnikov. The latter went to the window and waited with
Crime and Punishment irritable impatience till he calculated that Porfiry had 
reached the street and moved away. Then he too went hur -
riedly out of the room. Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comChapter III
He hurried to Svidrigaïlov’s. What he had to hope from 
that man he did not know. But that man had some hid -
den power over him. Having once recognised this, he could 
not rest, and now the time had come.
On the way, one question particularly worried him: had 
Svidrigaïlov been to Porfiry’s?
As far as he could judge, he would swear to it, that he had 
not. He pondered again and again, went over Porfiry’s visit; 
no, he hadn’t been, of course he hadn’t.
But if he had not been yet, would he go? Meanwhile, for 
the present he fancied he couldn’t. Why? He could not have 
explained, but if he could, he would not have wasted much 
thought over it at the moment. It all worried him and at the 
same time he could not attend to it. Strange to say, none 
would have believed it perhaps, but he only felt a faint vague 
anxiety about his immediate future. Another, much more 
important anxiety tormented him—it concerned himself, 
but in a different, more vital way. Moreover, he was con -
scious of immense moral fatigue, though his mind was 
working better that morning than it had done of late.
And was it worth while, after all that had happened, to 
contend with these new trivial difficulties? Was it worth 
while, for instance, to manœuvre that Svidrigaïlov should 
not go to Porfiry’s? Was it worth while to investigate, to
Crime and Punishment ascertain the facts, to waste time over anyone like Svidriga -
ïlov?
Oh, how sick he was of it all!
And yet he was hastening to Svidrigaïlov; could he be ex -
pecting something new from him, information, or means of 
escape? Men will catch at straws! Was it destiny or some in -
stinct bringing them together? Perhaps it was only fatigue, 
despair; perhaps it was not Svidrigaïlov but some other 
whom he needed, and Svidrigaïlov had simply presented 
himself by chance. Sonia? But what should he go to Sonia 
for now? To beg her tears again? He was afraid of Sonia, too. 
Sonia stood before him as an irrevocable sentence. He must 
go his own way or hers. At that moment especially he did 
not feel equal to seeing her. No, would it not be better to try 
Svidrigaïlov? And he could not help inwardly owning that 
he had long felt that he must see him for some reason.
But what could they have in common? Their very evil-
doing could not be of the same kind. The man, moreover, 
was very unpleasant, evidently depraved, undoubtedly cun -
ning and deceitful, possibly malignant. Such stories were 
told about him. It is true he was befriending Katerina Iva -
novna’s children, but who could tell with what motive and 
what it meant? The man always had some design, some proj -
ect.
There was another thought which had been continually 
hovering of late about Raskolnikov’s mind, and causing him 
great uneasiness. It was so painful that he made distinct ef -
forts to get rid of it. He sometimes thought that Svidrigaïlov 
was dogging his footsteps. Svidrigaïlov had found out his Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comsecret and had had designs on Dounia. What if he had them 
still? Wasn’t it practically certain that he had? And what if, 
having learnt his secret and so having gained power over 
him, he were to use it as a weapon against Dounia?
This idea sometimes even tormented his dreams, but it 
had never presented itself so vividly to him as on his way to 
Svidrigaïlov. The very thought moved him to gloomy rage. 
To begin with, this would transform everything, even his 
own position; he would have at once to confess his secret to 
Dounia. Would he have to give himself up perhaps to pre -
vent Dounia from taking some rash step? The letter? This 
morning Dounia had received a letter. From whom could 
she get letters in Petersburg? Luzhin, perhaps? It’s true Ra -
zumihin was there to protect her, but Razumihin knew 
nothing of the position. Perhaps it was his duty to tell Razu -
mihin? He thought of it with repugnance.
In any case he must see Svidrigaïlov as soon as possible, 
he decided finally. Thank God, the details of the interview 
were of little consequence, if only he could get at the root of 
the matter; but if Svidrigaïlov were capable … if he were in -
triguing against Dounia— then …
Raskolnikov was so exhausted by what he had passed 
through that month that he could only decide such ques -
tions in one way; ‘then I shall kill him,’ he thought in cold 
despair.
A sudden anguish oppressed his heart, he stood still in 
the middle of the street and began looking about to see 
where he was and which way he was going. He found himself 
in X. Prospect, thirty or forty paces from the Hay Market,
Crime and Punishment 0through which he had come. The whole second storey of 
the house on the left was used as a tavern. All the windows 
were wide open; judging from the figures moving at the 
windows, the rooms were full to overflowing. There were 
sounds of singing, of clarionet and violin, and the boom of 
a Turkish drum. He could hear women shrieking. He was 
about to turn back wondering why he had come to the X. 
Prospect, when suddenly at one of the end windows he saw 
Svidrigaïlov, sitting at a tea-table right in the open window 
with a pipe in his mouth. Raskolnikov was dreadfully taken 
aback, almost terrified. Svidrigaïlov was silently watching 
and scrutinising him and, what struck Raskolnikov at once, 
seemed to be meaning to get up and slip away unobserved. 
Raskolnikov at once pretended not to have seen him, but 
to be looking absent-mindedly away, while he watched him 
out of the corner of his eye. His heart was beating violently. 
Yet, it was evident that Svidrigaïlov did not want to be seen. 
He took the pipe out of his mouth and was on the point of 
concealing himself, but as he got up and moved back his 
chair, he seemed to have become suddenly aware that Ras -
kolnikov had seen him, and was watching him. What had 
passed between them was much the same as what happened 
at their first meeting in Raskolnikov’s room. A sly smile 
came into Svidrigaïlov’s face and grew broader and broader. 
Each knew that he was seen and watched by the other. At 
last Svidrigaïlov broke into a loud laugh.
‘Well, well, come in if you want me; I am here!’ he shout -
ed from the window.
Raskolnikov went up into the tavern. He found Svid - Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comrigaïlov in a tiny back room, adjoining the saloon in which 
merchants, clerks and numbers of people of all sorts were 
drinking tea at twenty little tables to the desperate bawl -
ing of a chorus of singers. The click of billiard balls could 
be heard in the distance. On the table before Svidrigaïlov 
stood an open bottle and a glass half full of champagne. In 
the room he found also a boy with a little hand organ, a 
healthy-looking red- cheeked girl of eighteen, wearing a 
tucked-up striped skirt, and a Tyrolese hat with ribbons. In 
spite of the chorus in the other room, she was singing some 
servants’ hall song in a rather husky contralto, to the ac -
companiment of the organ.
‘Come, that’s enough,’ Svidrigaïlov stopped her at Ras -
kolnikov’s entrance. The girl at once broke off and stood 
waiting respectfully. She had sung her guttural rhymes, too, 
with a serious and respectful expression in her face.
‘Hey, Philip, a glass!’ shouted Svidrigaïlov.
‘I won’t drink anything,’ said Raskolnikov.
‘As you like, I didn’t mean it for you. Drink, Katia! I don’t 
want anything more to-day, you can go.’ He poured her out 
a full glass, and laid down a yellow note.
Katia drank off her glass of wine, as women do, without 
putting it down, in twenty gulps, took the note and kissed 
Svidrigaïlov’s hand, which he allowed quite seriously. She 
went out of the room and the boy trailed after her with 
the organ. Both had been brought in from the street. Svid -
rigaïlov had not been a week in Petersburg, but everything 
about him was already, so to speak, on a patriarchal foot -
ing; the waiter, Philip, was by now an old friend and very
Crime and Punishment obsequious.
The door leading to the saloon had a lock on it. Svidriga -
ïlov was at home in this room and perhaps spent whole days 
in it. The tavern was dirty and wretched, not even second-
rate.
‘I was going to see you and looking for you,’ Raskol -
nikov began, ‘but I don’t know what made me turn from 
the Hay Market into the X. Prospect just now. I never take 
this turning. I turn to the right from the Hay Market. And 
this isn’t the way to you. I simply turned and here you are. 
It is strange!’
‘Why don’t you say at once ‘it’s a miracle’?’
‘Because it may be only chance.’
‘Oh, that’s the way with all you folk,’ laughed Svidriga -
ïlov. ‘You won’t admit it, even if you do inwardly believe it a 
miracle! Here you say that it may be only chance. And what 
cowards they all are here, about having an opinion of their 
own, you can’t fancy, Rodion Romanovitch. I don’t mean 
you, you have an opinion of your own and are not afraid to 
have it. That’s how it was you attracted my curiosity.’
‘Nothing else?’
‘Well, that’s enough, you know,’ Svidrigaïlov was obvi -
ously exhilarated, but only slightly so, he had not had more 
than half a glass of wine.
‘I fancy you came to see me before you knew that I was 
capable of having what you call an opinion of my own,’ ob -
served Raskolnikov.
‘Oh, well, it was a different matter. everyone has his own 
plans. And apropos of the miracle let me tell you that I Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comthink you have been asleep for the last two or three days. 
I told you of this tavern myself, there is no miracle in your 
coming straight here. I explained the way myself, told you 
where it was, and the hours you could find me here. Do you 
remember?’
‘I don’t remember,’ answered Raskolnikov with surprise.
‘I believe you. I told you twice. The address has been 
stamped mechanically on your memory. You turned this 
way mechanically and yet precisely according to the di -
rection, though you are not aware of it. When I told you 
then, I hardly hoped you understood me. You give your -
self away too much, Rodion Romanovitch. And another 
thing, I’m convinced there are lots of people in Petersburg 
who talk to themselves as they walk. This is a town of crazy 
people. If only we had scientific men, doctors, lawyers and 
philosophers might make most valuable investigations in 
Petersburg each in his own line. There are few places where 
there are so many gloomy, strong and queer influences on 
the soul of man as in Petersburg. The mere influences of cli -
mate mean so much. And it’s the administrative centre of 
all Russia and its character must be reflected on the whole 
country. But that is neither here nor there now. The point 
is that I have several times watched you. You walk out of 
your house—holding your head high—twenty paces from 
home you let it sink, and fold your hands behind your back. 
You look and evidently see nothing before nor beside you. 
At last you begin moving your lips and talking to yourself, 
and sometimes you wave one hand and declaim, and at last 
stand still in the middle of the road. That’s not at all the
Crime and Punishment thing. Someone may be watching you besides me, and it 
won’t do you any good. It’s nothing really to do with me and 
I can’t cure you, but, of course, you understand me.’
‘Do you know that I am being followed?’ asked Raskol -
nikov, looking inquisitively at him.
‘No, I know nothing about it,’ said Svidrigaïlov, seeming 
surprised.
‘Well, then, let us leave me alone,’ Raskolnikov muttered, 
frowning.
‘Very good, let us leave you alone.’
‘You had better tell me, if you come here to drink, and di -
rected me twice to come here to you, why did you hide, and 
try to get away just now when I looked at the window from 
the street? I saw it.’
‘He-he! And why was it you lay on your sofa with closed 
eyes and pretended to be asleep, though you were wide 
awake while I stood in your doorway? I saw it.’
‘I may have had … reasons. You know that yourself.’
‘And I may have had my reasons, though you don’t know 
them.’
Raskolnikov dropped his right elbow on the table, leaned 
his chin in the fingers of his right hand, and stared intent -
ly at Svidrigaïlov. For a full minute he scrutinised his face, 
which had impressed him before. It was a strange face, like 
a mask; white and red, with bright red lips, with a flaxen 
beard, and still thick flaxen hair. His eyes were somehow 
too blue and their expression somehow too heavy and fixed. 
There was something awfully unpleasant in that handsome 
face, which looked so wonderfully young for his age. Svid - Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comrigaïlov was smartly dressed in light summer clothes and 
was particularly dainty in his linen. He wore a huge ring 
with a precious stone in it.
‘Have I got to bother myself about you, too, now?’ said 
Raskolnikov suddenly, coming with nervous impatience 
straight to the point. ‘Even though perhaps you are the most 
dangerous man if you care to injure me, I don’t want to put 
myself out any more. I will show you at once that I don’t 
prize myself as you probably think I do. I’ve come to tell 
you at once that if you keep to your former intentions with 
regard to my sister and if you think to derive any benefit in 
that direction from what has been discovered of late, I will 
kill you before you get me locked up. You can reckon on my 
word. You know that I can keep it. And in the second place 
if you want to tell me anything —for I keep fancying all 
this time that you have something to tell me—make haste 
and tell it, for time is precious and very likely it will soon 
be too late.’
‘Why in such haste?’ asked Svidrigaïlov, looking at him 
curiously.
‘Everyone has his plans,’ Raskolnikov answered gloomily 
and impatiently.
‘You urged me yourself to frankness just now, and at the 
first question you refuse to answer,’ Svidrigaïlov observed 
with a smile. ‘You keep fancying that I have aims of my own 
and so you look at me with suspicion. Of course it’s perfect -
ly natural in your position. But though I should like to be 
friends with you, I shan’t trouble myself to convince you of 
the contrary. The game isn’t worth the candle and I wasn’t
Crime and Punishment intending to talk to you about anything special.’
‘What did you want me, for, then? It was you who came 
hanging about me.’
‘Why, simply as an interesting subject for observation. I 
liked the fantastic nature of your position—that’s what it 
was! Besides you are the brother of a person who greatly in -
terested me, and from that person I had in the past heard a 
very great deal about you, from which I gathered that you 
had a great influence over her; isn’t that enough? Ha-ha-ha! 
Still I must admit that your question is rather complex, and 
is difficult for me to answer. Here, you, for instance, have 
come to me not only for a definite object, but for the sake of 
hearing something new. Isn’t that so? Isn’t that so?’ persist -
ed Svidrigaïlov with a sly smile. ‘Well, can’t you fancy then 
that I, too, on my way here in the train was reckoning on 
you, on your telling me something new, and on my making 
some profit out of you! You see what rich men we are!’
‘What profit could you make?’
‘How can I tell you? How do I know? You see in what 
a tavern I spend all my time and it’s my enjoyment, that’s 
to say it’s no great enjoyment, but one must sit somewhere; 
that poor Katia now—you saw her? … If only I had been a 
glutton now, a club gourmand, but you see I can eat this.’
He pointed to a little table in the corner where the rem -
nants of a terrible-looking beef-steak and potatoes lay on a 
tin dish.
‘Have you dined, by the way? I’ve had something and 
want nothing more. I don’t drink, for instance, at all. Ex -
cept for champagne I never touch anything, and not more Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comthan a glass of that all the evening, and even that is enough 
to make my head ache. I ordered it just now to wind my -
self up, for I am just going off somewhere and you see me 
in a peculiar state of mind. That was why I hid myself just 
now like a schoolboy, for I was afraid you would hinder me. 
But I believe,’ he pulled out his watch, ‘I can spend an hour 
with you. It’s half-past four now. If only I’d been something, 
a landowner, a father, a cavalry officer, a photographer, a 
journalist … I am nothing, no specialty, and sometimes 
I am positively bored. I really thought you would tell me 
something new.’
‘But what are you, and why have you come here?’
‘What am I? You know, a gentleman, I served for two 
years in the cavalry, then I knocked about here in Pe -
tersburg, then I married Marfa Petrovna and lived in the 
country. There you have my biography!’
‘You are a gambler, I believe?’
‘No, a poor sort of gambler. A card-sharper—not a gam -
bler.’
‘You have been a card-sharper then?’
‘Yes, I’ve been a card-sharper too.’
‘Didn’t you get thrashed sometimes?’
‘It did happen. Why?’
‘Why, you might have challenged them … altogether it 
must have been lively.’
‘I won’t contradict you, and besides I am no hand at phi -
losophy. I confess that I hastened here for the sake of the 
women.’
‘As soon as you buried Marfa Petrovna?’
Crime and Punishment ‘Quite so,’ Svidrigaïlov smiled with engaging candour. 
‘What of it? You seem to find something wrong in my speak -
ing like that about women?’
‘You ask whether I find anything wrong in vice?’
‘Vice! Oh, that’s what you are after! But I’ll answer you 
in order, first about women in general; you know I am fond 
of talking. Tell me, what should I restrain myself for? Why 
should I give up women, since I have a passion for them? It’s 
an occupation, anyway.’
‘So you hope for nothing here but vice?’
‘Oh, very well, for vice then. You insist on its being vice. 
But anyway I like a direct question. In this vice at least there 
is something permanent, founded indeed upon nature and 
not dependent on fantasy, something present in the blood 
like an ever-burning ember, for ever setting one on fire and, 
maybe, not to be quickly extinguished, even with years. 
You’ll agree it’s an occupation of a sort.’
‘That’s nothing to rejoice at, it’s a disease and a danger -
ous one.’
‘Oh, that’s what you think, is it! I agree, that it is a disease 
like everything that exceeds moderation. And, of course, 
in this one must exceed moderation. But in the first place, 
everybody does so in one way or another, and in the sec -
ond place, of course, one ought to be moderate and prudent, 
however mean it may be, but what am I to do? If I hadn’t 
this, I might have to shoot myself. I am ready to admit that 
a decent man ought to put up with being bored, but yet …’
‘And could you shoot yourself?’
‘Oh, come!’ Svidrigaïlov parried with disgust. ‘Please Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comdon’t speak of it,’ he added hurriedly and with none of the 
bragging tone he had shown in all the previous conversa -
tion. His face quite changed. ‘I admit it’s an unpardonable 
weakness, but I can’t help it. I am afraid of death and I dis -
like its being talked of. Do you know that I am to a certain 
extent a mystic?’
‘Ah, the apparitions of Marfa Petrovna! Do they still go 
on visiting you?’
‘Oh, don’t talk of them; there have been no more in Pe -
tersburg, confound them!’ he cried with an air of irritation. 
‘Let’s rather talk of that … though … H’m! I have not much 
time, and can’t stay long with you, it’s a pity! I should have 
found plenty to tell you.’
‘What’s your engagement, a woman?’
‘Yes, a woman, a casual incident…. No, that’s not what I 
want to talk of.’
‘And the hideousness, the filthiness of all your surround -
ings, doesn’t that affect you? Have you lost the strength to 
stop yourself?’
‘And do you pretend to strength, too? He-he-he! You sur -
prised me just now, Rodion Romanovitch, though I knew 
beforehand it would be so. You preach to me about vice 
and æsthetics! You—a Schiller, you—an idealist! Of course 
that’s all as it should be and it would be surprising if it were 
not so, yet it is strange in reality…. Ah, what a pity I have 
no time, for you’re a most interesting type! And, by-the-way, 
are you fond of Schiller? I am awfully fond of him.’
‘But what a braggart you are,’ Raskolnikov said with 
some disgust.
Crime and Punishment 0‘Upon my word, I am not,’ answered Svidrigaïlov laugh -
ing. ‘However, I won’t dispute it, let me be a braggart, why 
not brag, if it hurts no one? I spent seven years in the coun -
try with Marfa Petrovna, so now when I come across an 
intelligent person like you—intelligent and highly interest -
ing—I am simply glad to talk and, besides, I’ve drunk that 
half-glass of champagne and it’s gone to my head a little. 
And besides, there’s a certain fact that has wound me up tre -
mendously, but about that I … will keep quiet. Where are 
you off to?’ he asked in alarm.
Raskolnikov had begun getting up. He felt oppressed 
and stifled and, as it were, ill at ease at having come here. 
He felt convinced that Svidrigaïlov was the most worthless 
scoundrel on the face of the earth.
‘A-ach! Sit down, stay a little!’ Svidrigaïlov begged. ‘Let 
them bring you some tea, anyway. Stay a little, I won’t talk 
nonsense, about myself, I mean. I’ll tell you something. If 
you like I’ll tell you how a woman tried ‘to save’ me, as you 
would call it? It will be an answer to your first question in -
deed, for the woman was your sister. May I tell you? It will 
help to spend the time.’
‘Tell me, but I trust that you …’
‘Oh, don’t be uneasy. Besides, even in a worthless low 
fellow like me, Avdotya Romanovna can only excite the 
deepest respect.’ Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comChapter IV
‘You know perhaps—yes, I told you myself,’ began Svid -
rigaïlov, ‘that I was in the debtors’ prison here, for an 
immense sum, and had not any expectation of being able 
to pay it. There’s no need to go into particulars how Marfa 
Petrovna bought me out; do you know to what a point of 
insanity a woman can sometimes love? She was an honest 
woman, and very sensible, although completely uneducat -
ed. Would you believe that this honest and jealous woman, 
after many scenes of hysterics and reproaches, condescend -
ed to enter into a kind of contract with me which she kept 
throughout our married life? She was considerably older 
than I, and besides, she always kept a clove or something 
in her mouth. There was so much swinishness in my soul 
and honesty too, of a sort, as to tell her straight out that I 
couldn’t be absolutely faithful to her. This confession drove 
her to frenzy, but yet she seems in a way to have liked my 
brutal frankness. She thought it showed I was unwilling 
to deceive her if I warned her like this beforehand and for 
a jealous woman, you know, that’s the first consideration. 
After many tears an unwritten contract was drawn up be -
tween us: first, that I would never leave Marfa Petrovna and 
would always be her husband; secondly, that I would never 
absent myself without her permission; thirdly, that I would 
never set up a permanent mistress; fourthly, in return for
Crime and Punishment this, Marfa Petrovna gave me a free hand with the maid -
servants, but only with her secret knowledge; fifthly, God 
forbid my falling in love with a woman of our class; sixthly, 
in case I—which God forbid—should be visited by a great 
serious passion I was bound to reveal it to Marfa Petrovna. 
On this last score, however, Marfa Petrovna was fairly at 
ease. She was a sensible woman and so she could not help 
looking upon me as a dissolute profligate incapable of real 
love. But a sensible woman and a jealous woman are two 
very different things, and that’s where the trouble came in. 
But to judge some people impartially we must renounce 
certain preconceived opinions and our habitual attitude to 
the ordinary people about us. I have reason to have faith in 
your judgment rather than in anyone’s. Perhaps you have 
already heard a great deal that was ridiculous and absurd 
about Marfa Petrovna. She certainly had some very ridicu -
lous ways, but I tell you frankly that I feel really sorry for 
the innumerable woes of which I was the cause. Well, and 
that’s enough, I think, by way of a decorous oraison funèbre  
for the most tender wife of a most tender husband. When 
we quarrelled, I usually held my tongue and did not irritate 
her and that gentlemanly conduct rarely failed to attain its 
object, it influenced her, it pleased her, indeed. These were 
times when she was positively proud of me. But your sister 
she couldn’t put up with, anyway. And however she came 
to risk taking such a beautiful creature into her house as a 
governess. My explanation is that Marfa Petrovna was an 
ardent and impressionable woman and simply fell in love 
herself—literally fell in love—with your sister. Well, little Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comwonder—look at Avdotya Romanovna! I saw the danger at 
the first glance and what do you think, I resolved not to 
look at her even. But Avdotya Romanovna herself made the 
first step, would you believe it? Would you believe it too that 
Marfa Petrovna was positively angry with me at first for my 
persistent silence about your sister, for my careless reception 
of her continual adoring praises of Avdotya Romanovna. I 
don’t know what it was she wanted! Well, of course, Mar -
fa Petrovna told Avdotya Romanovna every detail about 
me. She had the unfortunate habit of telling literally every -
one all our family secrets and continually complaining of 
me; how could she fail to confide in such a delightful new 
friend? I expect they talked of nothing else but me and no 
doubt Avdotya Romanovna heard all those dark mysterious 
rumours that were current about me…. I don’t mind betting 
that you too have heard something of the sort already?’
‘I have. Luzhin charged you with having caused the death 
of a child. Is that true?’
‘Don’t refer to those vulgar tales, I beg,’ said Svidriga -
ïlov with disgust and annoyance. ‘If you insist on wanting 
to know about all that idiocy, I will tell you one day, but 
now …’
‘I was told too about some footman of yours in the coun -
try whom you treated badly.’
‘I beg you to drop the subject,’ Svidrigaïlov interrupted 
again with obvious impatience.
‘Was that the footman who came to you after death to fill 
your pipe? … you told me about it yourself.’ Raskolnikov 
felt more and more irritated.
Crime and Punishment Svidrigaïlov looked at him attentively and Raskolnikov 
fancied he caught a flash of spiteful mockery in that look. 
But Svidrigaïlov restrained himself and answered very civ -
illy:
‘Yes, it was. I see that you, too, are extremely interested 
and shall feel it my duty to satisfy your curiosity at the first 
opportunity. Upon my soul! I see that I really might pass 
for a romantic figure with some people. Judge how grateful 
I must be to Marfa Petrovna for having repeated to Avdotya 
Romanovna such mysterious and interesting gossip about 
me. I dare not guess what impression it made on her, but 
in any case it worked in my interests. With all Avdotya Ro -
manovna’s natural aversion and in spite of my invariably 
gloomy and repellent aspect—she did at least feel pity for 
me, pity for a lost soul. And if once a girl’s heart is moved 
to pity it’s more dangerous than anything. She is bound to 
want to ‘save him,’ to bring him to his senses, and lift him 
up and draw him to nobler aims, and restore him to new 
life and usefulness—well, we all know how far such dreams 
can go. I saw at once that the bird was flying into the cage 
of herself. And I too made ready. I think you are frowning, 
Rodion Romanovitch? There’s no need. As you know, it all 
ended in smoke. (Hang it all, what a lot I am drinking!) Do 
you know, I always, from the very beginning, regretted that 
it wasn’t your sister’s fate to be born in the second or third 
century A.D., as the daughter of a reigning prince or some 
governor or pro-consul in Asia Minor. She would undoubt -
edly have been one of those who would endure martyrdom 
and would have smiled when they branded her bosom with Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comhot pincers. And she would have gone to it of herself. And 
in the fourth or fifth century she would have walked away 
into the Egyptian desert and would have stayed there thirty 
years living on roots and ecstasies and visions. She is simply 
thirsting to face some torture for someone, and if she can’t 
get her torture, she’ll throw herself out of a window. I’ve 
heard something of a Mr. Razumihin—he’s said to be a sen -
sible fellow; his surname suggests it, indeed. He’s probably 
a divinity student. Well, he’d better look after your sister! 
I believe I understand her, and I am proud of it. But at the 
beginning of an acquaintance, as you know, one is apt to 
be more heedless and stupid. One doesn’t see clearly. Hang 
it all, why is she so handsome? It’s not my fault. In fact, it 
began on my side with a most irresistible physical desire. 
Avdotya Romanovna is awfully chaste, incredibly and phe -
nomenally so. Take note, I tell you this about your sister as 
a fact. She is almost morbidly chaste, in spite of her broad 
intelligence, and it will stand in her way. There happened 
to be a girl in the house then, Parasha, a black-eyed wench, 
whom I had never seen before—she had just come from an -
other village—very pretty, but incredibly stupid: she burst 
into tears, wailed so that she could be heard all over the 
place and caused scandal. One day after dinner Avdotya 
Romanovna followed me into an avenue in the garden and 
with flashing eyes insisted  on my leaving poor Parasha 
alone. It was almost our first conversation by ourselves. I, 
of course, was only too pleased to obey her wishes, tried to 
appear disconcerted, embarrassed, in fact played my part 
not badly. Then came interviews, mysterious conversations,
Crime and Punishment exhortations, entreaties, supplications, even tears—would 
you believe it, even tears? Think what the passion for pro -
paganda will bring some girls to! I, of course, threw it all on 
my destiny, posed as hungering and thirsting for light, and 
finally resorted to the most powerful weapon in the subjec -
tion of the female heart, a weapon which never fails one. It’s 
the well-known resource—flattery. Nothing in the world is 
harder than speaking the truth and nothing easier than flat -
tery. If there’s the hundredth part of a false note in speaking 
the truth, it leads to a discord, and that leads to trouble. But 
if all, to the last note, is false in flattery, it is just as agreeable, 
and is heard not without satisfaction. It may be a coarse 
satisfaction, but still a satisfaction. And however coarse the 
flattery, at least half will be sure to seem true. That’s so for 
all stages of development and classes of society. A vestal 
virgin might be seduced by flattery. I can never remember 
without laughter how I once seduced a lady who was devot -
ed to her husband, her children, and her principles. What 
fun it was and how little trouble! And the lady really had 
principles—of her own, anyway. All my tactics lay in simply 
being utterly annihilated and prostrate before her purity. I 
flattered her shamelessly, and as soon as I succeeded in get -
ting a pressure of the hand, even a glance from her, I would 
reproach myself for having snatched it by force, and would 
declare that she had resisted, so that I could never have 
gained anything but for my being so unprincipled. I main -
tained that she was so innocent that she could not foresee 
my treachery, and yielded to me unconsciously, unawares, 
and so on. In fact, I triumphed, while my lady remained Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comfirmly convinced that she was innocent, chaste, and faithful 
to all her duties and obligations and had succumbed quite 
by accident. And how angry she was with me when I ex -
plained to her at last that it was my sincere conviction that 
she was just as eager as I. Poor Marfa Petrovna was awfully 
weak on the side of flattery, and if I had only cared to, I 
might have had all her property settled on me during her 
lifetime. (I am drinking an awful lot of wine now and talk -
ing too much.) I hope you won’t be angry if I mention now 
that I was beginning to produce the same effect on Avdotya 
Romanovna. But I was stupid and impatient and spoiled it 
all. Avdotya Romanovna had several times—and one time 
in particular—been greatly displeased by the expression of 
my eyes, would you believe it? There was sometimes a light 
in them which frightened her and grew stronger and stron -
ger and more unguarded till it was hateful to her. No need 
to go into detail, but we parted. There I acted stupidly again. 
I fell to jeering in the coarsest way at all such propaganda 
and efforts to convert me; Parasha came on to the scene 
again, and not she alone; in fact there was a tremendous 
to-do. Ah, Rodion Romanovitch, if you could only see how 
your sister’s eyes can flash sometimes! Never mind my be -
ing drunk at this moment and having had a whole glass of 
wine. I am speaking the truth. I assure you that this glance 
has haunted my dreams; the very rustle of her dress was 
more than I could stand at last. I really began to think that 
I might become epileptic. I could never have believed that I 
could be moved to such a frenzy. It was essential, indeed, to 
be reconciled, but by then it was impossible. And imagine
Crime and Punishment what I did then! To what a pitch of stupidity a man can be 
brought by frenzy! Never undertake anything in a frenzy, 
Rodion Romanovitch. I reflected that Avdotya Romanovna 
was after all a beggar (ach, excuse me, that’s not the word 
… but does it matter if it expresses the meaning?), that she 
lived by her work, that she had her mother and you to keep 
(ach, hang it, you are frowning again), and I resolved to 
offer her all my money—thirty thousand roubles I could 
have realised then—if she would run away with me here, 
to Petersburg. Of course I should have vowed eternal love, 
rapture, and so on. Do you know, I was so wild about her 
at that time that if she had told me to poison Marfa Petro -
vna or to cut her throat and to marry herself, it would have 
been done at once! But it ended in the catastrophe of which 
you know already. You can fancy how frantic I was when I 
heard that Marfa Petrovna had got hold of that scoundrelly 
attorney, Luzhin, and had almost made a match between 
them—which would really have been just the same thing 
as I was proposing. Wouldn’t it? Wouldn’t it? I notice that 
you’ve begun to be very attentive … you interesting young 
man….’
Svidrigaïlov struck the table with his fist impatiently. 
He was flushed. Raskolnikov saw clearly that the glass or 
glass and a half of champagne that he had sipped almost 
unconsciously was affecting him— and he resolved to take 
advantage of the opportunity. He felt very suspicious of 
Svidrigaïlov.
‘Well, after what you have said, I am fully convinced that 
you have come to Petersburg with designs on my sister,’ he Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comsaid directly to Svidrigaïlov, in order to irritate him fur -
ther.
‘Oh, nonsense,’ said Svidrigaïlov, seeming to rouse him -
self. ‘Why, I told you … besides your sister can’t endure 
me.’
‘Yes, I am certain that she can’t, but that’s not the point.’
‘Are you so sure that she can’t?’ Svidrigaïlov screwed up 
his eyes and smiled mockingly. ‘You are right, she doesn’t 
love me, but you can never be sure of what has passed be -
tween husband and wife or lover and mistress. There’s 
always a little corner which remains a secret to the world 
and is only known to those two. Will you answer for it that 
Avdotya Romanovna regarded me with aversion?’
‘From some words you’ve dropped, I notice that you still 
have designs —and of course evil ones—on Dounia and 
mean to carry them out promptly.’
‘What, have I dropped words like that?’ Svidrigaïlov 
asked in naïve dismay, taking not the slightest notice of the 
epithet bestowed on his designs.
‘Why, you are dropping them even now. Why are you so 
frightened? What are you so afraid of now?’
‘Me—afraid? Afraid of you? You have rather to be afraid 
of me, cher ami . But what nonsense…. I’ve drunk too much 
though, I see that. I was almost saying too much again. 
Damn the wine! Hi! there, water!’
He snatched up the champagne bottle and flung it with -
out ceremony out of the window. Philip brought the water.
‘That’s all nonsense!’ said Svidrigaïlov, wetting a tow -
el and putting it to his head. ‘But I can answer you in one
Crime and Punishment 0word and annihilate all your suspicions. Do you know that 
I am going to get married?’
‘You told me so before.’
‘Did I? I’ve forgotten. But I couldn’t have told you so for 
certain for I had not even seen my betrothed; I only meant 
to. But now I really have a betrothed and it’s a settled thing, 
and if it weren’t that I have business that can’t be put off, I 
would have taken you to see them at once, for I should like 
to ask your advice. Ach, hang it, only ten minutes left! See, 
look at the watch. But I must tell you, for it’s an interesting 
story, my marriage, in its own way. Where are you off to? 
Going again?’
‘No, I’m not going away now.’
‘Not at all? We shall see. I’ll take you there, I’ll show you 
my betrothed, only not now. For you’ll soon have to be off. 
You have to go to the right and I to the left. Do you know that 
Madame Resslich, the woman I am lodging with now, eh? 
I know what you’re thinking, that she’s the woman whose 
girl they say drowned herself in the winter. Come, are you 
listening? She arranged it all for me. You’re bored, she said, 
you want something to fill up your time. For, you know, I am 
a gloomy, depressed person. Do you think I’m light-heart -
ed? No, I’m gloomy. I do no harm, but sit in a corner without 
speaking a word for three days at a time. And that Resslich 
is a sly hussy, I tell you. I know what she has got in her mind; 
she thinks I shall get sick of it, abandon my wife and depart, 
and she’ll get hold of her and make a profit out of her—in 
our class, of course, or higher. She told me the father was a 
broken-down retired official, who has been sitting in a chair Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comfor the last three years with his legs paralysed. The mamma, 
she said, was a sensible woman. There is a son serving in 
the provinces, but he doesn’t help; there is a daughter, who 
is married, but she doesn’t visit them. And they’ve two little 
nephews on their hands, as though their own children were 
not enough, and they’ve taken from school their youngest 
daughter, a girl who’ll be sixteen in another month, so that 
then she can be married. She was for me. We went there. 
How funny it was! I present myself—a landowner, a widow -
er, of a well- known name, with connections, with a fortune. 
What if I am fifty and she is not sixteen? Who thinks of 
that? But it’s fascinating, isn’t it? It is fascinating, ha-ha! 
You should have seen how I talked to the papa and mamma. 
It was worth paying to have seen me at that moment. She 
comes in, curtseys, you can fancy, still in a short frock—an 
unopened bud! Flushing like a sunset—she had been told, 
no doubt. I don’t know how you feel about female faces, but 
to my mind these sixteen years, these childish eyes, shyness 
and tears of bashfulness are better than beauty; and she is 
a perfect little picture, too. Fair hair in little curls, like a 
lamb’s, full little rosy lips, tiny feet, a charmer! … Well, we 
made friends. I told them I was in a hurry owing to domes -
tic circumstances, and the next day, that is the day before 
yesterday, we were betrothed. When I go now I take her on 
my knee at once and keep her there…. Well, she flushes 
like a sunset and I kiss her every minute. Her mamma of 
course impresses on her that this is her husband and that 
this must be so. It’s simply delicious! The present betrothed 
condition is perhaps better than marriage. Here you have
Crime and Punishment what is called la nature et la vérité  ha-ha! I’ve talked to her 
twice, she is far from a fool. Sometimes she steals a look at 
me that positively scorches me. Her face is like Raphael’s 
Madonna. You know, the Sistine Madonna’s face has some -
thing fantastic in it, the face of mournful religious ecstasy. 
Haven’t you noticed it? Well, she’s something in that line. 
The day after we’d been betrothed, I bought her presents to 
the value of fifteen hundred roubles—a set of diamonds and 
another of pearls and a silver dressing-case as large as this, 
with all sorts of things in it, so that even my Madonna’s face 
glowed. I sat her on my knee, yesterday, and I suppose rath -
er too unceremoniously—she flushed crimson and the tears 
started, but she didn’t want to show it. We were left alone, 
she suddenly flung herself on my neck (for the first time 
of her own accord), put her little arms round me, kissed 
me, and vowed that she would be an obedient, faithful, and 
good wife, would make me happy, would devote all her life, 
every minute of her life, would sacrifice everything, every -
thing, and that all she asks in return is my respect  and that 
she wants ‘nothing, nothing more from me, no presents.’ 
You’ll admit that to hear such a confession, alone, from an 
angel of sixteen in a muslin frock, with little curls, with a 
flush of maiden shyness in her cheeks and tears of enthusi -
asm in her eyes is rather fascinating! Isn’t it fascinating? It’s 
worth paying for, isn’t it? Well … listen, we’ll go to see my 
betrothed, only not just now!’
‘The fact is this monstrous difference in age and develop -
ment excites your sensuality! Will you really make such a 
marriage?’ Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com‘Why, of course. Everyone thinks of himself, and he lives 
most gaily who knows best how to deceive himself. Ha-ha! 
But why are you so keen about virtue? Have mercy on me, 
my good friend. I am a sinful man. Ha- ha-ha!’
‘But you have provided for the children of Katerina Iva -
novna. Though … though you had your own reasons…. I 
understand it all now.’
‘I am always fond of children, very fond of them,’ laughed 
Svidrigaïlov. ‘I can tell you one curious instance of it. The 
first day I came here I visited various haunts, after seven 
years I simply rushed at them. You probably notice that I am 
not in a hurry to renew acquaintance with my old friends. I 
shall do without them as long as I can. Do you know, when 
I was with Marfa Petrovna in the country, I was haunted 
by the thought of these places where anyone who knows 
his way about can find a great deal. Yes, upon my soul! The 
peasants have vodka, the educated young people, shut out 
from activity, waste themselves in impossible dreams and 
visions and are crippled by theories; Jews have sprung up 
and are amassing money, and all the rest give themselves up 
to debauchery. From the first hour the town reeked of its fa -
miliar odours. I chanced to be in a frightful den—I like my 
dens dirty—it was a dance, so called, and there was a cancan  
such as I never saw in my day. Yes, there you have progress. 
All of a sudden I saw a little girl of thirteen, nicely dressed, 
dancing with a specialist in that line, with another one vis-
à-vis . Her mother was sitting on a chair by the wall. You 
can’t fancy what a cancan  that was! The girl was ashamed, 
blushed, at last felt insulted, and began to cry. Her partner
Crime and Punishment seized her and began whirling her round and performing 
before her; everyone laughed and—I like your public, even 
the cancan  public—they laughed and shouted, ‘Serves her 
right— serves her right! Shouldn’t bring children!’ Well, 
it’s not my business whether that consoling reflection was 
logical or not. I at once fixed on my plan, sat down by the 
mother, and began by saying that I too was a stranger and 
that people here were ill-bred and that they couldn’t distin -
guish decent folks and treat them with respect, gave her to 
understand that I had plenty of money, offered to take them 
home in my carriage. I took them home and got to know 
them. They were lodging in a miserable little hole and had 
only just arrived from the country. She told me that she and 
her daughter could only regard my acquaintance as an hon -
our. I found out that they had nothing of their own and had 
come to town upon some legal business. I proffered my ser -
vices and money. I learnt that they had gone to the dancing 
saloon by mistake, believing that it was a genuine danc -
ing class. I offered to assist in the young girl’s education in 
French and dancing. My offer was accepted with enthusi -
asm as an honour—and we are still friendly…. If you like, 
we’ll go and see them, only not just now.’
‘Stop! Enough of your vile, nasty anecdotes, depraved 
vile, sensual man!’
‘Schiller, you are a regular Schiller! O la vertu va-t-elle se 
nicher?  But you know I shall tell you these things on pur -
pose, for the pleasure of hearing your outcries!’
‘I dare say. I can see I am ridiculous myself,’ muttered 
Raskolnikov angrily. Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comSvidrigaïlov laughed heartily; finally he called Philip, 
paid his bill, and began getting up.
‘I say, but I am drunk, assez causé  ’ he said. ‘It’s been a 
pleasure.’
‘I should rather think it must be a pleasure!’ cried Raskol -
nikov, getting up. ‘No doubt it is a pleasure for a worn-out 
profligate to describe such adventures with a monstrous 
project of the same sort in his mind—especially under such 
circumstances and to such a man as me…. It’s stimulating!’
‘Well, if you come to that,’ Svidrigaïlov answered, scruti -
nising Raskolnikov with some surprise, ‘if you come to that, 
you are a thorough cynic yourself. You’ve plenty to make 
you so, anyway. You can understand a great deal … and you 
can do a great deal too. But enough. I sincerely regret not 
having had more talk with you, but I shan’t lose sight of 
you…. Only wait a bit.’
Svidrigaïlov walked out of the restaurant. Raskolnikov 
walked out after him. Svidrigaïlov was not however very 
drunk, the wine had affected him for a moment, but it was 
passing off every minute. He was preoccupied with some -
thing of importance and was frowning. He was apparently 
excited and uneasy in anticipation of something. His man -
ner to Raskolnikov had changed during the last few minutes, 
and he was ruder and more sneering every moment. Ras -
kolnikov noticed all this, and he too was uneasy. He became 
very suspicious of Svidrigaïlov and resolved to follow him.
They came out on to the pavement.
‘You go to the right, and I to the left, or if you like, the 
other way. Only adieu, mon plaisir  may we meet again.’
Crime and Punishment And he walked to the right towards the Hay Market. Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comChapter V
Raskolnikov walked after him.
‘What’s this?’ cried Svidrigaïlov turning round, ‘I 
thought I said …’
‘It means that I am not going to lose sight of you now.’
‘What?’
Both stood still and gazed at one another, as though 
measuring their strength.
‘From all your half tipsy stories,’ Raskolnikov observed 
harshly, ‘I am positive  that you have not given up your de -
signs on my sister, but are pursuing them more actively than 
ever. I have learnt that my sister received a letter this morn -
ing. You have hardly been able to sit still all this time…. 
You may have unearthed a wife on the way, but that means 
nothing. I should like to make certain myself.’
Raskolnikov could hardly have said himself what he 
wanted and of what he wished to make certain.
‘Upon my word! I’ll call the police!’
‘Call away!’
Again they stood for a minute facing each other. At last 
Svidrigaïlov’s face changed. Having satisfied himself that 
Raskolnikov was not frightened at his threat, he assumed a 
mirthful and friendly air.
‘What a fellow! I purposely refrained from referring to 
your affair, though I am devoured by curiosity. It’s a fantas -
Crime and Punishment tic affair. I’ve put it off till another time, but you’re enough 
to rouse the dead…. Well, let us go, only I warn you be -
forehand I am only going home for a moment, to get some 
money; then I shall lock up the flat, take a cab and go to 
spend the evening at the Islands. Now, now are you going 
to follow me?’
‘I’m coming to your lodgings, not to see you but Sofya 
Semyonovna, to say I’m sorry not to have been at the fu -
neral.’
‘That’s as you like, but Sofya Semyonovna is not at home. 
She has taken the three children to an old lady of high rank, 
the patroness of some orphan asylums, whom I used to 
know years ago. I charmed the old lady by depositing a sum 
of money with her to provide for the three children of Kat -
erina Ivanovna and subscribing to the institution as well. I 
told her too the story of Sofya Semyonovna in full detail, 
suppressing nothing. It produced an indescribable effect 
on her. That’s why Sofya Semyonovna has been invited to 
call to-day at the X. Hotel where the lady is staying for the 
time.’
‘No matter, I’ll come all the same.’
‘As you like, it’s nothing to me, but I won’t come with 
you; here we are at home. By the way, I am convinced that 
you regard me with suspicion just because I have shown 
such delicacy and have not so far troubled you with ques -
tions … you understand? It struck you as extraordinary; I 
don’t mind betting it’s that. Well, it teaches one to show del -
icacy!’
‘And to listen at doors!’ Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com‘Ah, that’s it, is it?’ laughed Svidrigaïlov. ‘Yes, I should 
have been surprised if you had let that pass after all that 
has happened. Ha-ha! Though I did understand something 
of the pranks you had been up to and were telling Sofya 
Semyonovna about, what was the meaning of it? Perhaps 
I am quite behind the times and can’t understand. For 
goodness’ sake, explain it, my dear boy. Expound the lat -
est theories!’
‘You couldn’t have heard anything. You’re making it all 
up!’
‘But I’m not talking about that (though I did hear some -
thing). No, I’m talking of the way you keep sighing and 
groaning now. The Schiller in you is in revolt every moment, 
and now you tell me not to listen at doors. If that’s how you 
feel, go and inform the police that you had this mischance: 
you made a little mistake in your theory. But if you are con -
vinced that one mustn’t listen at doors, but one may murder 
old women at one’s pleasure, you’d better be off to America 
and make haste. Run, young man! There may still be time. 
I’m speaking sincerely. Haven’t you the money? I’ll give you 
the fare.’
‘I’m not thinking of that at all,’ Raskolnikov interrupted 
with disgust.
‘I understand (but don’t put yourself out, don’t discuss 
it if you don’t want to). I understand the questions you are 
worrying over— moral ones, aren’t they? Duties of citizen 
and man? Lay them all aside. They are nothing to you now, 
ha-ha! You’ll say you are still a man and a citizen. If so you 
ought not to have got into this coil. It’s no use taking up a
Crime and Punishment 0job you are not fit for. Well, you’d better shoot yourself, or 
don’t you want to?’
‘You seem trying to enrage me, to make me leave you.’
‘What a queer fellow! But here we are. Welcome to the 
staircase. You see, that’s the way to Sofya Semyonovna. Look, 
there is no one at home. Don’t you believe me? Ask Kaper -
naumov. She leaves the key with him. Here is Madame de 
Kapernaumov herself. Hey, what? She is rather deaf. Has 
she gone out? Where? Did you hear? She is not in and won’t 
be till late in the evening probably. Well, come to my room; 
you wanted to come and see me, didn’t you? Here we are. 
Madame Resslich’s not at home. She is a woman who is al -
ways busy, an excellent woman I assure you…. She might 
have been of use to you if you had been a little more sensible. 
Now, see! I take this five-per-cent bond out of the bureau—
see what a lot I’ve got of them still—this one will be turned 
into cash to-day. I mustn’t waste any more time. The bureau 
is locked, the flat is locked, and here we are again on the 
stairs. Shall we take a cab? I’m going to the Islands. Would 
you like a lift? I’ll take this carriage. Ah, you refuse? You are 
tired of it! Come for a drive! I believe it will come on to rain. 
Never mind, we’ll put down the hood….’
Svidrigaïlov was already in the carriage. Raskolnikov 
decided that his suspicions were at least for that moment 
unjust. Without answering a word he turned and walked 
back towards the Hay Market. If he had only turned round 
on his way he might have seen Svidrigaïlov get out not a 
hundred paces off, dismiss the cab and walk along the pave -
ment. But he had turned the corner and could see nothing. Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comIntense disgust drew him away from Svidrigaïlov.
‘To think that I could for one instant have looked for help 
from that coarse brute, that depraved sensualist and black -
guard!’ he cried.
Raskolnikov’s judgment was uttered too lightly and 
hastily: there was something about Svidrigaïlov which 
gave him a certain original, even a mysterious character. 
As concerned his sister, Raskolnikov was convinced that 
Svidrigaïlov would not leave her in peace. But it was too 
tiresome and unbearable to go on thinking and thinking 
about this.
When he was alone, he had not gone twenty paces before 
he sank, as usual, into deep thought. On the bridge he stood 
by the railing and began gazing at the water. And his sister 
was standing close by him.
He met her at the entrance to the bridge, but passed by 
without seeing her. Dounia had never met him like this in 
the street before and was struck with dismay. She stood still 
and did not know whether to call to him or not. Suddenly 
she saw Svidrigaïlov coming quickly from the direction of 
the Hay Market.
He seemed to be approaching cautiously. He did not go 
on to the bridge, but stood aside on the pavement, doing 
all he could to avoid Raskolnikov’s seeing him. He had ob -
served Dounia for some time and had been making signs to 
her. She fancied he was signalling to beg her not to speak to 
her brother, but to come to him.
That was what Dounia did. She stole by her brother and 
went up to Svidrigaïlov.
Crime and Punishment ‘Let us make haste away,’ Svidrigaïlov whispered to her, 
‘I don’t want Rodion Romanovitch to know of our meeting. 
I must tell you I’ve been sitting with him in the restaurant 
close by, where he looked me up and I had great difficulty 
in getting rid of him. He has somehow heard of my letter to 
you and suspects something. It wasn’t you who told him, of 
course, but if not you, who then?’
‘Well, we’ve turned the corner now,’ Dounia interrupted, 
‘and my brother won’t see us. I have to tell you that I am go -
ing no further with you. Speak to me here. You can tell it all 
in the street.’
‘In the first place, I can’t say it in the street; secondly, you 
must hear Sofya Semyonovna too; and, thirdly, I will show 
you some papers…. Oh well, if you won’t agree to come with 
me, I shall refuse to give any explanation and go away at 
once. But I beg you not to forget that a very curious secret of 
your beloved brother’s is entirely in my keeping.’
Dounia stood still, hesitating, and looked at Svidrigaïlov 
with searching eyes.
‘What are you afraid of?’ he observed quietly. ‘The town 
is not the country. And even in the country you did me 
more harm than I did you.’
‘Have you prepared Sofya Semyonovna?’
‘No, I have not said a word to her and am not quite cer -
tain whether she is at home now. But most likely she is. She 
has buried her stepmother to-day: she is not likely to go vis -
iting on such a day. For the time I don’t want to speak to 
anyone about it and I half regret having spoken to you. The 
slightest indiscretion is as bad as betrayal in a thing like Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comthis. I live there in that house, we are coming to it. That’s the 
porter of our house—he knows me very well; you see, he’s 
bowing; he sees I’m coming with a lady and no doubt he has 
noticed your face already and you will be glad of that if you 
are afraid of me and suspicious. Excuse my putting things 
so coarsely. I haven’t a flat to myself; Sofya Semyonovna’s 
room is next to mine—she lodges in the next flat. The whole 
floor is let out in lodgings. Why are you frightened like a 
child? Am I really so terrible?’
Svidrigaïlov’s lips were twisted in a condescending 
smile; but he was in no smiling mood. His heart was throb -
bing and he could scarcely breathe. He spoke rather loud to 
cover his growing excitement. But Dounia did not notice 
this peculiar excitement, she was so irritated by his remark 
that she was frightened of him like a child and that he was 
so terrible to her.
‘Though I know that you are not a man … of honour, I 
am not in the least afraid of you. Lead the way,’ she said 
with apparent composure, but her face was very pale.
Svidrigaïlov stopped at Sonia’s room.
‘Allow me to inquire whether she is at home…. She is not. 
How unfortunate! But I know she may come quite soon. If 
she’s gone out, it can only be to see a lady about the orphans. 
Their mother is dead…. I’ve been meddling and making ar -
rangements for them. If Sofya Semyonovna does not come 
back in ten minutes, I will send her to you, to-day if you like. 
This is my flat. These are my two rooms. Madame Resslich, 
my landlady, has the next room. Now, look this way. I will 
show you my chief piece of evidence: this door from my
Crime and Punishment bedroom leads into two perfectly empty rooms, which are 
to let. Here they are … You must look into them with some 
attention.’
Svidrigaïlov occupied two fairly large furnished rooms. 
Dounia was looking about her mistrustfully, but saw noth -
ing special in the furniture or position of the rooms. Yet 
there was something to observe, for instance, that Svidriga -
ïlov’s flat was exactly between two sets of almost uninhabited 
apartments. His rooms were not entered directly from the 
passage, but through the landlady’s two almost empty 
rooms. Unlocking a door leading out of his bedroom, Svid -
rigaïlov showed Dounia the two empty rooms that were to 
let. Dounia stopped in the doorway, not knowing what she 
was called to look upon, but Svidrigaïlov hastened to ex -
plain.
‘Look here, at this second large room. Notice that door, 
it’s locked. By the door stands a chair, the only one in the 
two rooms. I brought it from my rooms so as to listen 
more conveniently. Just the other side of the door is Sofya 
Semyonovna’s table; she sat there talking to Rodion Roma -
novitch. And I sat here listening on two successive evenings, 
for two hours each time—and of course I was able to learn 
something, what do you think?’
‘You listened?’
‘Yes, I did. Now come back to my room; we can’t sit down 
here.’
He brought Avdotya Romanovna back into his sitting-
room and offered her a chair. He sat down at the opposite 
side of the table, at least seven feet from her, but probably Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comthere was the same glow in his eyes which had once fright -
ened Dounia so much. She shuddered and once more looked 
about her distrustfully. It was an involuntary gesture; she 
evidently did not wish to betray her uneasiness. But the 
secluded position of Svidrigaïlov’s lodging had suddenly 
struck her. She wanted to ask whether his landlady at least 
were at home, but pride kept her from asking. Moreover, she 
had another trouble in her heart incomparably greater than 
fear for herself. She was in great distress.
‘Here is your letter,’ she said, laying it on the table. ‘Can 
it be true what you write? You hint at a crime committed, 
you say, by my brother. You hint at it too clearly; you daren’t 
deny it now. I must tell you that I’d heard of this stupid 
story before you wrote and don’t believe a word of it. It’s a 
disgusting and ridiculous suspicion. I know the story and 
why and how it was invented. You can have no proofs. You 
promised to prove it. Speak! But let me warn you that I don’t 
believe you! I don’t believe you!’
Dounia said this, speaking hurriedly, and for an instant 
the colour rushed to her face.
‘If you didn’t believe it, how could you risk coming alone 
to my rooms? Why have you come? Simply from curiosity?’
‘Don’t torment me. Speak, speak!’
‘There’s no denying that you are a brave girl. Upon my 
word, I thought you would have asked Mr. Razumihin to 
escort you here. But he was not with you nor anywhere 
near. I was on the look-out. It’s spirited of you, it proves you 
wanted to spare Rodion Romanovitch. But everything is di -
vine in you…. About your brother, what am I to say to you?
Crime and Punishment You’ve just seen him yourself. What did you think of him?’
‘Surely that’s not the only thing you are building on?’
‘No, not on that, but on his own words. He came here 
on two successive evenings to see Sofya Semyonovna. I’ve 
shown you where they sat. He made a full confession to 
her. He is a murderer. He killed an old woman, a pawnbro -
ker, with whom he had pawned things himself. He killed 
her sister too, a pedlar woman called Lizaveta, who hap -
pened to come in while he was murdering her sister. He 
killed them with an axe he brought with him. He murdered 
them to rob them and he did rob them. He took money and 
various things…. He told all this, word for word, to Sofya 
Semyonovna, the only person who knows his secret. But 
she has had no share by word or deed in the murder; she 
was as horrified at it as you are now. Don’t be anxious, she 
won’t betray him.’
‘It cannot be,’ muttered Dounia, with white lips. She 
gasped for breath. ‘It cannot be. There was not the slightest 
cause, no sort of ground…. It’s a lie, a lie!’
‘He robbed her, that was the cause, he took money and 
things. It’s true that by his own admission he made no use 
of the money or things, but hid them under a stone, where 
they are now. But that was because he dared not make use 
of them.’
‘But how could he steal, rob? How could he dream of it?’ 
cried Dounia, and she jumped up from the chair. ‘Why, you 
know him, and you’ve seen him, can he be a thief?’
She seemed to be imploring Svidrigaïlov; she had entire -
ly forgotten her fear. Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com‘There are thousands and millions of combinations and 
possibilities, Avdotya Romanovna. A thief steals and knows 
he is a scoundrel, but I’ve heard of a gentleman who broke 
open the mail. Who knows, very likely he thought he was 
doing a gentlemanly thing! Of course I should not have 
believed it myself if I’d been told of it as you have, but I be -
lieve my own ears. He explained all the causes of it to Sofya 
Semyonovna too, but she did not believe her ears at first, yet 
she believed her own eyes at last.’
‘What … were the causes?’
‘It’s a long story, Avdotya Romanovna. Here’s … how 
shall I tell you?—A theory of a sort, the same one by which 
I for instance consider that a single misdeed is permissible 
if the principal aim is right, a solitary wrongdoing and hun -
dreds of good deeds! It’s galling too, of course, for a young 
man of gifts and overweening pride to know that if he had, 
for instance, a paltry three thousand, his whole career, his 
whole future would be differently shaped and yet not to 
have that three thousand. Add to that, nervous irritability 
from hunger, from lodging in a hole, from rags, from a vivid 
sense of the charm of his social position and his sister’s and 
mother’s position too. Above all, vanity, pride and vanity, 
though goodness knows he may have good qualities too…. 
I am not blaming him, please don’t think it; besides, it’s not 
my business. A special little theory came in too—a theory 
of a sort—dividing mankind, you see, into material and su -
perior persons, that is persons to whom the law does not 
apply owing to their superiority, who make laws for the rest 
of mankind, the material, that is. It’s all right as a theory,
Crime and Punishment une théorie comme une autre . Napoleon attracted him tre -
mendously, that is, what affected him was that a great many 
men of genius have not hesitated at wrongdoing, but have 
overstepped the law without thinking about it. He seems 
to have fancied that he was a genius too—that is, he was 
convinced of it for a time. He has suffered a great deal and 
is still suffering from the idea that he could make a theory, 
but was incapable of boldly overstepping the law, and so he 
is not a man of genius. And that’s humiliating for a young 
man of any pride, in our day especially….’
‘But remorse? You deny him any moral feeling then? Is 
he like that?’
‘Ah, Avdotya Romanovna, everything is in a muddle now; 
not that it was ever in very good order. Russians in general 
are broad in their ideas, Avdotya Romanovna, broad like 
their land and exceedingly disposed to the fantastic, the 
chaotic. But it’s a misfortune to be broad without a special 
genius. Do you remember what a lot of talk we had together 
on this subject, sitting in the evenings on the terrace after 
supper? Why, you used to reproach me with breadth! Who 
knows, perhaps we were talking at the very time when he 
was lying here thinking over his plan. There are no sacred 
traditions amongst us, especially in the educated class, Av -
dotya Romanovna. At the best someone will make them up 
somehow for himself out of books or from some old chron -
icle. But those are for the most part the learned and all old 
fogeys, so that it would be almost ill-bred in a man of so -
ciety. You know my opinions in general, though. I never 
blame anyone. I do nothing at all, I persevere in that. But Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comwe’ve talked of this more than once before. I was so happy 
indeed as to interest you in my opinions…. You are very 
pale, Avdotya Romanovna.’
‘I know his theory. I read that article of his about men to 
whom all is permitted. Razumihin brought it to me.’
‘Mr. Razumihin? Your brother’s article? In a magazine? 
Is there such an article? I didn’t know. It must be interesting. 
But where are you going, Avdotya Romanovna?’
‘I want to see Sofya Semyonovna,’ Dounia articulated 
faintly. ‘How do I go to her? She has come in, perhaps. I 
must see her at once. Perhaps she …’
Avdotya Romanovna could not finish. Her breath liter -
ally failed her.
‘Sofya Semyonovna will not be back till night, at least I 
believe not. She was to have been back at once, but if not, 
then she will not be in till quite late.’
‘Ah, then you are lying! I see … you were lying … lying 
all the time…. I don’t believe you! I don’t believe you!’ cried 
Dounia, completely losing her head.
Almost fainting, she sank on to a chair which Svidriga -
ïlov made haste to give her.
‘Avdotya Romanovna, what is it? Control yourself! Here 
is some water. Drink a little….’
He sprinkled some water over her. Dounia shuddered 
and came to herself.
‘It has acted violently,’ Svidrigaïlov muttered to himself, 
frowning. ‘Avdotya Romanovna, calm yourself! Believe me, 
he has friends. We will save him. Would you like me to take 
him abroad? I have money, I can get a ticket in three days.
Crime and Punishment 0And as for the murder, he will do all sorts of good deeds yet, 
to atone for it. Calm yourself. He may become a great man 
yet. Well, how are you? How do you feel?’
‘Cruel man! To be able to jeer at it! Let me go …’
‘Where are you going?’
‘To him. Where is he? Do you know? Why is this door 
locked? We came in at that door and now it is locked. When 
did you manage to lock it?’
‘We couldn’t be shouting all over the flat on such a sub -
ject. I am far from jeering; it’s simply that I’m sick of talking 
like this. But how can you go in such a state? Do you want 
to betray him? You will drive him to fury, and he will give 
himself up. Let me tell you, he is already being watched; they 
are already on his track. You will simply be giving him away. 
Wait a little: I saw him and was talking to him just now. He 
can still be saved. Wait a bit, sit down; let us think it over to -
gether. I asked you to come in order to discuss it alone with 
you and to consider it thoroughly. But do sit down!’
‘How can you save him? Can he really be saved?’
Dounia sat down. Svidrigaïlov sat down beside her.
‘It all depends on you, on you, on you alone,’ he begin 
with glowing eyes, almost in a whisper and hardly able to 
utter the words for emotion.
Dounia drew back from him in alarm. He too was trem -
bling all over.
‘You … one word from you, and he is saved. I … I’ll save 
him. I have money and friends. I’ll send him away at once. 
I’ll get a passport, two passports, one for him and one for 
me. I have friends … capable people…. If you like, I’ll take Free eBooks at Planet eBook.coma passport for you … for your mother…. What do you want 
with Razumihin? I love you too…. I love you beyond every -
thing…. Let me kiss the hem of your dress, let me, let me…. 
The very rustle of it is too much for me. Tell me, ‘do that,’ 
and I’ll do it. I’ll do everything. I will do the impossible. 
What you believe, I will believe. I’ll do anything —any -
thing! Don’t, don’t look at me like that. Do you know that 
you are killing me? …’
He was almost beginning to rave…. Something seemed 
suddenly to go to his head. Dounia jumped up and rushed 
to the door.
‘Open it! Open it!’ she called, shaking the door. ‘Open it! 
Is there no one there?’
Svidrigaïlov got up and came to himself. His still trem -
bling lips slowly broke into an angry mocking smile.
‘There is no one at home,’ he said quietly and emphatical -
ly. ‘The landlady has gone out, and it’s waste of time to shout 
like that. You are only exciting yourself uselessly.’
‘Where is the key? Open the door at once, at once, base 
man!’
‘I have lost the key and cannot find it.’
‘This is an outrage,’ cried Dounia, turning pale as death. 
She rushed to the furthest corner, where she made haste to 
barricade herself with a little table.
She did not scream, but she fixed her eyes on her tormen -
tor and watched every movement he made.
Svidrigaïlov remained standing at the other end of the 
room facing her. He was positively composed, at least in 
appearance, but his face was pale as before. The mocking
Crime and Punishment smile did not leave his face.
‘You spoke of outrage just now, Avdotya Romanovna. 
In that case you may be sure I’ve taken measures. Sofya 
Semyonovna is not at home. The Kapernaumovs are far 
away—there are five locked rooms between. I am at least 
twice as strong as you are and I have nothing to fear, besides. 
For you could not complain afterwards. You surely would 
not be willing actually to betray your brother? Besides, no 
one would believe you. How should a girl have come alone 
to visit a solitary man in his lodgings? So that even if you 
do sacrifice your brother, you could prove nothing. It is very 
difficult to prove an assault, Avdotya Romanovna.’
‘Scoundrel!’ whispered Dounia indignantly.
‘As you like, but observe I was only speaking by way of 
a general proposition. It’s my personal conviction that you 
are perfectly right —violence is hateful. I only spoke to show 
you that you need have no remorse even if … you were will -
ing to save your brother of your own accord, as I suggest to 
you. You would be simply submitting to circumstances, to 
violence, in fact, if we must use that word. Think about it. 
Your brother’s and your mother’s fate are in your hands. I 
will be your slave … all my life … I will wait here.’
Svidrigaïlov sat down on the sofa about eight steps from 
Dounia. She had not the slightest doubt now of his unbend -
ing determination. Besides, she knew him. Suddenly she 
pulled out of her pocket a revolver, cocked it and laid it in 
her hand on the table. Svidrigaïlov jumped up.
‘Aha! So that’s it, is it?’ he cried, surprised but smil -
ing maliciously. ‘Well, that completely alters the aspect of Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comaffairs. You’ve made things wonderfully easier for me, Av -
dotya Romanovna. But where did you get the revolver? Was 
it Mr. Razumihin? Why, it’s my revolver, an old friend! And 
how I’ve hunted for it! The shooting lessons I’ve given you 
in the country have not been thrown away.’
‘It’s not your revolver, it belonged to Marfa Petrovna, 
whom you killed, wretch! There was nothing of yours in her 
house. I took it when I began to suspect what you were ca -
pable of. If you dare to advance one step, I swear I’ll kill you.’ 
She was frantic.
‘But your brother? I ask from curiosity,’ said Svidrigaïlov, 
still standing where he was.
‘Inform, if you want to! Don’t stir! Don’t come nearer! I’ll 
shoot! You poisoned your wife, I know; you are a murderer 
yourself!’ She held the revolver ready.
‘Are you so positive I poisoned Marfa Petrovna?’
‘You did! You hinted it yourself; you talked to me of 
poison…. I know you went to get it … you had it in readi -
ness…. It was your doing…. It must have been your doing…. 
Scoundrel!’
‘Even if that were true, it would have been for your sake 
… you would have been the cause.’
‘You are lying! I hated you always, always….’
‘Oho, Avdotya Romanovna! You seem to have forgotten 
how you softened to me in the heat of propaganda. I saw it 
in your eyes. Do you remember that moonlight night, when 
the nightingale was singing?’
‘That’s a lie,’ there was a flash of fury in Dounia’s eyes, 
‘that’s a lie and a libel!’
Crime and Punishment ‘A lie? Well, if you like, it’s a lie. I made it up. Women 
ought not to be reminded of such things,’ he smiled. ‘I know 
you will shoot, you pretty wild creature. Well, shoot away!’
Dounia raised the revolver, and deadly pale, gazed at 
him, measuring the distance and awaiting the first move -
ment on his part. Her lower lip was white and quivering and 
her big black eyes flashed like fire. He had never seen her so 
handsome. The fire glowing in her eyes at the moment she 
raised the revolver seemed to kindle him and there was a 
pang of anguish in his heart. He took a step forward and a 
shot rang out. The bullet grazed his hair and flew into the 
wall behind. He stood still and laughed softly.
‘The wasp has stung me. She aimed straight at my head. 
What’s this? Blood?’ he pulled out his handkerchief to wipe 
the blood, which flowed in a thin stream down his right 
temple. The bullet seemed to have just grazed the skin.
Dounia lowered the revolver and looked at Svidrigaïlov 
not so much in terror as in a sort of wild amazement. She 
seemed not to understand what she was doing and what 
was going on.
‘Well, you missed! Fire again, I’ll wait,’ said Svidrigaïlov 
softly, still smiling, but gloomily. ‘If you go on like that, I 
shall have time to seize you before you cock again.’
Dounia started, quickly cocked the pistol and again 
raised it.
‘Let me be,’ she cried in despair. ‘I swear I’ll shoot again. 
I … I’ll kill you.’
‘Well … at three paces you can hardly help it. But if you 
don’t … then.’ His eyes flashed and he took two steps for - Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comward. Dounia shot again: it missed fire.
‘You haven’t loaded it properly. Never mind, you have an -
other charge there. Get it ready, I’ll wait.’
He stood facing her, two paces away, waiting and gazing 
at her with wild determination, with feverishly passionate, 
stubborn, set eyes. Dounia saw that he would sooner die 
than let her go. ‘And … now, of course she would kill him, at 
two paces!’ Suddenly she flung away the revolver.
‘She’s dropped it!’ said Svidrigaïlov with surprise, and he 
drew a deep breath. A weight seemed to have rolled from 
his heart—perhaps not only the fear of death; indeed he 
may scarcely have felt it at that moment. It was the deliver -
ance from another feeling, darker and more bitter, which he 
could not himself have defined.
He went to Dounia and gently put his arm round her 
waist. She did not resist, but, trembling like a leaf, looked at 
him with suppliant eyes. He tried to say something, but his 
lips moved without being able to utter a sound.
‘Let me go,’ Dounia implored. Svidrigaïlov shuddered. 
Her voice now was quite different.
‘Then you don’t love me?’ he asked softly. Dounia shook 
her head.
‘And … and you can’t? Never?’ he whispered in despair.
‘Never!’
There followed a moment of terrible, dumb struggle in 
the heart of Svidrigaïlov. He looked at her with an indescrib -
able gaze. Suddenly he withdrew his arm, turned quickly to 
the window and stood facing it. Another moment passed.
‘Here’s the key.’
Crime and Punishment He took it out of the left pocket of his coat and laid it on 
the table behind him, without turning or looking at Dou -
nia.
‘Take it! Make haste!’
He looked stubbornly out of the window. Dounia went 
up to the table to take the key.
‘Make haste! Make haste!’ repeated Svidrigaïlov, still 
without turning or moving. But there seemed a terrible sig -
nificance in the tone of that ‘make haste.’
Dounia understood it, snatched up the key, flew to the 
door, unlocked it quickly and rushed out of the room. A 
minute later, beside herself, she ran out on to the canal bank 
in the direction of X. Bridge.
Svidrigaïlov remained three minutes standing at the 
window. At last he slowly turned, looked about him and 
passed his hand over his forehead. A strange smile con -
torted his face, a pitiful, sad, weak smile, a smile of despair. 
The blood, which was already getting dry, smeared his hand. 
He looked angrily at it, then wetted a towel and washed his 
temple. The revolver which Dounia had flung away lay near 
the door and suddenly caught his eye. He picked it up and 
examined it. It was a little pocket three-barrel revolver of 
old-fashioned construction. There were still two charges 
and one capsule left in it. It could be fired again. He thought 
a little, put the revolver in his pocket, took his hat and went 
out. Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comChapter VI
He spent that evening till ten o’clock going from one low 
haunt to another. Katia too turned up and sang an -
other gutter song, how a certain ‘villain and tyrant began 
kissing Katia.’
Svidrigaïlov treated Katia and the organ-grinder and 
some singers and the waiters and two little clerks. He was 
particularly drawn to these clerks by the fact that they both 
had crooked noses, one bent to the left and the other to the 
right. They took him finally to a pleasure garden, where he 
paid for their entrance. There was one lanky three- year-old 
pine-tree and three bushes in the garden, besides a ‘Vaux -
hall,’ which was in reality a drinking-bar where tea too was 
served, and there were a few green tables and chairs stand -
ing round it. A chorus of wretched singers and a drunken 
but exceedingly depressed German clown from Munich 
with a red nose entertained the public. The clerks quarrelled 
with some other clerks and a fight seemed imminent. Svid -
rigaïlov was chosen to decide the dispute. He listened to 
them for a quarter of an hour, but they shouted so loud that 
there was no possibility of understanding them. The only 
fact that seemed certain was that one of them had stolen 
something and had even succeeded in selling it on the spot 
to a Jew, but would not share the spoil with his companion. 
Finally it appeared that the stolen object was a teaspoon be -
Crime and Punishment longing to the Vauxhall. It was missed and the affair began 
to seem troublesome. Svidrigaïlov paid for the spoon, got 
up, and walked out of the garden. It was about six o’clock. 
He had not drunk a drop of wine all this time and had or -
dered tea more for the sake of appearances than anything.
It was a dark and stifling evening. Threatening storm-
clouds came over the sky about ten o’clock. There was a 
clap of thunder, and the rain came down like a waterfall. 
The water fell not in drops, but beat on the earth in streams. 
There were flashes of lightning every minute and each flash 
lasted while one could count five.
Drenched to the skin, he went home, locked himself in, 
opened the bureau, took out all his money and tore up two 
or three papers. Then, putting the money in his pocket, he 
was about to change his clothes, but, looking out of the win -
dow and listening to the thunder and the rain, he gave up 
the idea, took up his hat and went out of the room with -
out locking the door. He went straight to Sonia. She was at 
home.
She was not alone: the four Kapernaumov children were 
with her. She was giving them tea. She received Svidrigaïlov 
in respectful silence, looking wonderingly at his soaking 
clothes. The children all ran away at once in indescribable 
terror.
Svidrigaïlov sat down at the table and asked Sonia to sit 
beside him. She timidly prepared to listen.
‘I may be going to America, Sofya Semyonovna,’ said 
Svidrigaïlov, ‘and as I am probably seeing you for the last 
time, I have come to make some arrangements. Well, did Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comyou see the lady to-day? I know what she said to you, you 
need not tell me.’ (Sonia made a movement and blushed.) 
‘Those people have their own way of doing things. As to 
your sisters and your brother, they are really provided for 
and the money assigned to them I’ve put into safe keeping 
and have received acknowledgments. You had better take 
charge of the receipts, in case anything happens. Here, take 
them! Well now, that’s settled. Here are three 5-per-cent 
bonds to the value of three thousand roubles. Take those 
for yourself, entirely for yourself, and let that be strictly be -
tween ourselves, so that no one knows of it, whatever you 
hear. You will need the money, for to go on living in the 
old way, Sofya Semyonovna, is bad, and besides there is no 
need for it now.’
‘I am so much indebted to you, and so are the children 
and my stepmother,’ said Sonia hurriedly, ‘and if I’ve said so 
little … please don’t consider …’
‘That’s enough! that’s enough!’
‘But as for the money, Arkady Ivanovitch, I am very grate -
ful to you, but I don’t need it now. I can always earn my own 
living. Don’t think me ungrateful. If you are so charitable, 
that money….’
‘It’s for you, for you, Sofya Semyonovna, and please don’t 
waste words over it. I haven’t time for it. You will want it. Ro -
dion Romanovitch has two alternatives: a bullet in the brain 
or Siberia.’ (Sonia looked wildly at him, and started.) ‘Don’t 
be uneasy, I know all about it from himself and I am not a 
gossip; I won’t tell anyone. It was good advice when you told 
him to give himself up and confess. It would be much bet -
Crime and Punishment 00ter for him. Well, if it turns out to be Siberia, he will go and 
you will follow him. That’s so, isn’t it? And if so, you’ll need 
money. You’ll need it for him, do you understand? Giving 
it to you is the same as my giving it to him. Besides, you 
promised Amalia Ivanovna to pay what’s owing. I heard 
you. How can you undertake such obligations so heedless -
ly, Sofya Semyonovna? It was Katerina Ivanovna’s debt and 
not yours, so you ought not to have taken any notice of the 
German woman. You can’t get through the world like that. 
If you are ever questioned about me—to-morrow or the day 
after you will be asked—don’t say anything about my com -
ing to see you now and don’t show the money to anyone or 
say a word about it. Well, now good- bye.’ (He got up.) ‘My 
greetings to Rodion Romanovitch. By the way, you’d better 
put the money for the present in Mr. Razumihin’s keeping. 
You know Mr. Razumihin? Of course you do. He’s not a bad 
fellow. Take it to him to-morrow or … when the time comes. 
And till then, hide it carefully.’
Sonia too jumped up from her chair and looked in dis -
may at Svidrigaïlov. She longed to speak, to ask a question, 
but for the first moments she did not dare and did not know 
how to begin.
‘How can you … how can you be going now, in such 
rain?’
‘Why, be starting for America, and be stopped by rain! 
Ha, ha! Good- bye, Sofya Semyonovna, my dear! Live and 
live long, you will be of use to others. By the way … tell Mr. 
Razumihin I send my greetings to him. Tell him Arkady 
Ivanovitch Svidrigaïlov sends his greetings. Be sure to.’
01 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comHe went out, leaving Sonia in a state of wondering anxi -
ety and vague apprehension.
It appeared afterwards that on the same evening, at 
twenty past eleven, he made another very eccentric and 
unexpected visit. The rain still persisted. Drenched to 
the skin, he walked into the little flat where the parents 
of his betrothed lived, in Third Street in Vassilyevsky Is -
land. He knocked some time before he was admitted, and 
his visit at first caused great perturbation; but Svidrigaïlov 
could be very fascinating when he liked, so that the first, 
and indeed very intelligent surmise of the sensible parents 
that Svidrigaïlov had probably had so much to drink that 
he did not know what he was doing vanished immediate -
ly. The decrepit father was wheeled in to see Svidrigaïlov 
by the tender and sensible mother, who as usual began the 
conversation with various irrelevant questions. She never 
asked a direct question, but began by smiling and rubbing 
her hands and then, if she were obliged to ascertain some -
thing—for instance, when Svidrigaïlov would like to have 
the wedding—she would begin by interested and almost ea -
ger questions about Paris and the court life there, and only 
by degrees brought the conversation round to Third Street. 
On other occasions this had of course been very impressive, 
but this time Arkady Ivanovitch seemed particularly impa -
tient, and insisted on seeing his betrothed at once, though 
he had been informed, to begin with, that she had already 
gone to bed. The girl of course appeared.
Svidrigaïlov informed her at once that he was obliged 
by very important affairs to leave Petersburg for a time,
Crime and Punishment 0and therefore brought her fifteen thousand roubles and 
begged her accept them as a present from him, as he had 
long been intending to make her this trifling present be -
fore their wedding. The logical connection of the present 
with his immediate departure and the absolute necessity of 
visiting them for that purpose in pouring rain at midnight 
was not made clear. But it all went off very well; even the 
inevitable ejaculations of wonder and regret, the inevitable 
questions were extraordinarily few and restrained. On the 
other hand, the gratitude expressed was most glowing and 
was reinforced by tears from the most sensible of mothers. 
Svidrigaïlov got up, laughed, kissed his betrothed, patted 
her cheek, declared he would soon come back, and noticing 
in her eyes, together with childish curiosity, a sort of ear -
nest dumb inquiry, reflected and kissed her again, though 
he felt sincere anger inwardly at the thought that his pres -
ent would be immediately locked up in the keeping of the 
most sensible of mothers. He went away, leaving them all in 
a state of extraordinary excitement, but the tender mam -
ma, speaking quietly in a half whisper, settled some of the 
most important of their doubts, concluding that Svidriga -
ïlov was a great man, a man of great affairs and connections 
and of great wealth—there was no knowing what he had 
in his mind. He would start off on a journey and give away 
money just as the fancy took him, so that there was nothing 
surprising about it. Of course it was strange that he was wet 
through, but Englishmen, for instance, are even more ec -
centric, and all these people of high society didn’t think of 
what was said of them and didn’t stand on ceremony. Pos -
0 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comsibly, indeed, he came like that on purpose to show that he 
was not afraid of anyone. Above all, not a word should be 
said about it, for God knows what might come of it, and the 
money must be locked up, and it was most fortunate that 
Fedosya, the cook, had not left the kitchen. And above all 
not a word must be said to that old cat, Madame Resslich, 
and so on and so on. They sat up whispering till two o’clock, 
but the girl went to bed much earlier, amazed and rather 
sorrowful.
Svidrigaïlov meanwhile, exactly at midnight, crossed 
the bridge on the way back to the mainland. The rain had 
ceased and there was a roaring wind. He began shivering, 
and for one moment he gazed at the black waters of the Lit -
tle Neva with a look of special interest, even inquiry. But he 
soon felt it very cold, standing by the water; he turned and 
went towards Y. Prospect. He walked along that endless 
street for a long time, almost half an hour, more than once 
stumbling in the dark on the wooden pavement, but contin -
ually looking for something on the right side of the street. 
He had noticed passing through this street lately that there 
was a hotel somewhere towards the end, built of wood, but 
fairly large, and its name he remembered was something 
like Adrianople. He was not mistaken: the hotel was so con -
spicuous in that God-forsaken place that he could not fail 
to see it even in the dark. It was a long, blackened wooden 
building, and in spite of the late hour there were lights in 
the windows and signs of life within. He went in and asked 
a ragged fellow who met him in the corridor for a room. The 
latter, scanning Svidrigaïlov, pulled himself together and
Crime and Punishment 0led him at once to a close and tiny room in the distance, at 
the end of the corridor, under the stairs. There was no other, 
all were occupied. The ragged fellow looked inquiringly.
‘Is there tea?’ asked Svidrigaïlov.
‘Yes, sir.’
‘What else is there?’
‘Veal, vodka, savouries.’
‘Bring me tea and veal.’
‘And you want nothing else?’ he asked with apparent sur -
prise.
‘Nothing, nothing.’
The ragged man went away, completely disillusioned.
‘It must be a nice place,’ thought Svidrigaïlov. ‘How was 
it I didn’t know it? I expect I look as if I came from a café 
chantant and have had some adventure on the way. It would 
be interesting to know who stay here?’
He lighted the candle and looked at the room more care -
fully. It was a room so low-pitched that Svidrigaïlov could 
only just stand up in it; it had one window; the bed, which 
was very dirty, and the plain- stained chair and table almost 
filled it up. The walls looked as though they were made of 
planks, covered with shabby paper, so torn and dusty that 
the pattern was indistinguishable, though the general co -
lour—yellow—could still be made out. One of the walls was 
cut short by the sloping ceiling, though the room was not 
an attic but just under the stairs.
Svidrigaïlov set down the candle, sat down on the bed 
and sank into thought. But a strange persistent murmur 
which sometimes rose to a shout in the next room attracted
0 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comhis attention. The murmur had not ceased from the moment 
he entered the room. He listened: someone was upbraiding 
and almost tearfully scolding, but he heard only one voice.
Svidrigaïlov got up, shaded the light with his hand and 
at once he saw light through a crack in the wall; he went 
up and peeped through. The room, which was somewhat 
larger than his, had two occupants. One of them, a very 
curly-headed man with a red inflamed face, was standing 
in the pose of an orator, without his coat, with his legs wide 
apart to preserve his balance, and smiting himself on the 
breast. He reproached the other with being a beggar, with 
having no standing whatever. He declared that he had tak -
en the other out of the gutter and he could turn him out 
when he liked, and that only the finger of Providence sees it 
all. The object of his reproaches was sitting in a chair, and 
had the air of a man who wants dreadfully to sneeze, but 
can’t. He sometimes turned sheepish and befogged eyes on 
the speaker, but obviously had not the slightest idea what 
he was talking about and scarcely heard it. A candle was 
burning down on the table; there were wine-glasses, a near -
ly empty bottle of vodka, bread and cucumber, and glasses 
with the dregs of stale tea. After gazing attentively at this, 
Svidrigaïlov turned away indifferently and sat down on the 
bed.
The ragged attendant, returning with the tea, could not 
resist asking him again whether he didn’t want anything 
more, and again receiving a negative reply, finally withdrew. 
Svidrigaïlov made haste to drink a glass of tea to warm him -
self, but could not eat anything. He began to feel feverish.
Crime and Punishment 0He took off his coat and, wrapping himself in the blanket, 
lay down on the bed. He was annoyed. ‘It would have been 
better to be well for the occasion,’ he thought with a smile. 
The room was close, the candle burnt dimly, the wind was 
roaring outside, he heard a mouse scratching in the corner 
and the room smelt of mice and of leather. He lay in a sort 
of reverie: one thought followed another. He felt a longing 
to fix his imagination on something. ‘It must be a garden 
under the window,’ he thought. ‘There’s a sound of trees. 
How I dislike the sound of trees on a stormy night, in the 
dark! They give one a horrid feeling.’ He remembered how 
he had disliked it when he passed Petrovsky Park just now. 
This reminded him of the bridge over the Little Neva and he 
felt cold again as he had when standing there. ‘I never have 
liked water,’ he thought, ‘even in a landscape,’ and he sud -
denly smiled again at a strange idea: ‘Surely now all these 
questions of taste and comfort ought not to matter, but I’ve 
become more particular, like an animal that picks out a spe -
cial place … for such an occasion. I ought to have gone into 
the Petrovsky Park! I suppose it seemed dark, cold, ha-ha! 
As though I were seeking pleasant sensations! … By the way, 
why haven’t I put out the candle?’ he blew it out. ‘They’ve 
gone to bed next door,’ he thought, not seeing the light at 
the crack. ‘Well, now, Marfa Petrovna, now is the time for 
you to turn up; it’s dark, and the very time and place for you. 
But now you won’t come!’
He suddenly recalled how, an hour before carrying out 
his design on Dounia, he had recommended Raskolnikov 
to trust her to Razumihin’s keeping. ‘I suppose I really did
0 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comsay it, as Raskolnikov guessed, to tease myself. But what a 
rogue that Raskolnikov is! He’s gone through a good deal. 
He may be a successful rogue in time when he’s got over his 
nonsense. But now he’s too eager for life. These young men 
are contemptible on that point. But, hang the fellow! Let 
him please himself, it’s nothing to do with me.’
He could not get to sleep. By degrees Dounia’s image 
rose before him, and a shudder ran over him. ‘No, I must 
give up all that now,’ he thought, rousing himself. ‘I must 
think of something else. It’s queer and funny. I never had 
a great hatred for anyone, I never particularly desired to 
avenge myself even, and that’s a bad sign, a bad sign, a bad 
sign. I never liked quarrelling either, and never lost my tem -
per— that’s a bad sign too. And the promises I made her 
just now, too— Damnation! But—who knows?—perhaps 
she would have made a new man of me somehow….’
He ground his teeth and sank into silence again. Again 
Dounia’s image rose before him, just as she was when, after 
shooting the first time, she had lowered the revolver in ter -
ror and gazed blankly at him, so that he might have seized 
her twice over and she would not have lifted a hand to de -
fend herself if he had not reminded her. He recalled how at 
that instant he felt almost sorry for her, how he had felt a 
pang at his heart …
‘Aïe! Damnation, these thoughts again! I must put it 
away!’
He was dozing off; the feverish shiver had ceased, when 
suddenly something seemed to run over his arm and leg 
under the bedclothes. He started. ‘Ugh! hang it! I believe
Crime and Punishment 0it’s a mouse,’ he thought, ‘that’s the veal I left on the table.’ 
He felt fearfully disinclined to pull off the blanket, get up, 
get cold, but all at once something unpleasant ran over his 
leg again. He pulled off the blanket and lighted the candle. 
Shaking with feverish chill he bent down to examine the 
bed: there was nothing. He shook the blanket and suddenly 
a mouse jumped out on the sheet. He tried to catch it, but 
the mouse ran to and fro in zigzags without leaving the bed, 
slipped between his fingers, ran over his hand and suddenly 
darted under the pillow. He threw down the pillow, but in 
one instant felt something leap on his chest and dart over 
his body and down his back under his shirt. He trembled 
nervously and woke up.
The room was dark. He was lying on the bed and wrapped 
up in the blanket as before. The wind was howling under 
the window. ‘How disgusting,’ he thought with annoyance.
He got up and sat on the edge of the bedstead with his 
back to the window. ‘It’s better not to sleep at all,’ he de -
cided. There was a cold damp draught from the window, 
however; without getting up he drew the blanket over him 
and wrapped himself in it. He was not thinking of anything 
and did not want to think. But one image rose after anoth -
er, incoherent scraps of thought without beginning or end 
passed through his mind. He sank into drowsiness. Per -
haps the cold, or the dampness, or the dark, or the wind 
that howled under the window and tossed the trees roused a 
sort of persistent craving for the fantastic. He kept dwelling 
on images of flowers, he fancied a charming flower garden, 
a bright, warm, almost hot day, a holiday—Trinity day. A
0 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comfine, sumptuous country cottage in the English taste over -
grown with fragrant flowers, with flower beds going round 
the house; the porch, wreathed in climbers, was surrounded 
with beds of roses. A light, cool staircase, carpeted with rich 
rugs, was decorated with rare plants in china pots. He no -
ticed particularly in the windows nosegays of tender, white, 
heavily fragrant narcissus bending over their bright, green, 
thick long stalks. He was reluctant to move away from 
them, but he went up the stairs and came into a large, high 
drawing-room and again everywhere—at the windows, the 
doors on to the balcony, and on the balcony itself—were 
flowers. The floors were strewn with freshly-cut fragrant 
hay, the windows were open, a fresh, cool, light air came 
into the room. The birds were chirruping under the win -
dow, and in the middle of the room, on a table covered with 
a white satin shroud, stood a coffin. The coffin was covered 
with white silk and edged with a thick white frill; wreaths 
of flowers surrounded it on all sides. Among the flowers 
lay a girl in a white muslin dress, with her arms crossed 
and pressed on her bosom, as though carved out of marble. 
But her loose fair hair was wet; there was a wreath of roses 
on her head. The stern and already rigid profile of her face 
looked as though chiselled of marble too, and the smile on 
her pale lips was full of an immense unchildish misery and 
sorrowful appeal. Svidrigaïlov knew that girl; there was no 
holy image, no burning candle beside the coffin; no sound 
of prayers: the girl had drowned herself. She was only four -
teen, but her heart was broken. And she had destroyed 
herself, crushed by an insult that had appalled and amazed
Crime and Punishment 10that childish soul, had smirched that angel purity with un -
merited disgrace and torn from her a last scream of despair, 
unheeded and brutally disregarded, on a dark night in the 
cold and wet while the wind howled….
Svidrigaïlov came to himself, got up from the bed and 
went to the window. He felt for the latch and opened it. The 
wind lashed furiously into the little room and stung his face 
and his chest, only covered with his shirt, as though with 
frost. Under the window there must have been something 
like a garden, and apparently a pleasure garden. There, too, 
probably there were tea-tables and singing in the daytime. 
Now drops of rain flew in at the window from the trees and 
bushes; it was dark as in a cellar, so that he could only just 
make out some dark blurs of objects. Svidrigaïlov, bending 
down with elbows on the window-sill, gazed for five min -
utes into the darkness; the boom of a cannon, followed by a 
second one, resounded in the darkness of the night. ‘Ah, the 
signal! The river is overflowing,’ he thought. ‘By morning it 
will be swirling down the street in the lower parts, flood -
ing the basements and cellars. The cellar rats will swim out, 
and men will curse in the rain and wind as they drag their 
rubbish to their upper storeys. What time is it now?’ And he 
had hardly thought it when, somewhere near, a clock on the 
wall, ticking away hurriedly, struck three.
‘Aha! It will be light in an hour! Why wait? I’ll go out 
at once straight to the park. I’ll choose a great bush there 
drenched with rain, so that as soon as one’s shoulder touch -
es it, millions of drops drip on one’s head.’
He moved away from the window, shut it, lighted the
11 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comcandle, put on his waistcoat, his overcoat and his hat and 
went out, carrying the candle, into the passage to look for 
the ragged attendant who would be asleep somewhere in 
the midst of candle-ends and all sorts of rubbish, to pay 
him for the room and leave the hotel. ‘It’s the best minute; I 
couldn’t choose a better.’
He walked for some time through a long narrow corridor 
without finding anyone and was just going to call out, when 
suddenly in a dark corner between an old cupboard and the 
door he caught sight of a strange object which seemed to 
be alive. He bent down with the candle and saw a little girl, 
not more than five years old, shivering and crying, with her 
clothes as wet as a soaking house-flannel. She did not seem 
afraid of Svidrigaïlov, but looked at him with blank amaze -
ment out of her big black eyes. Now and then she sobbed as 
children do when they have been crying a long time, but are 
beginning to be comforted. The child’s face was pale and 
tired, she was numb with cold. ‘How can she have come 
here? She must have hidden here and not slept all night.’ He 
began questioning her. The child suddenly becoming an -
imated, chattered away in her baby language, something 
about ‘mammy’ and that ‘mammy would beat her,’ and 
about some cup that she had ‘bwoken.’ The child chattered 
on without stopping. He could only guess from what she 
said that she was a neglected child, whose mother, prob -
ably a drunken cook, in the service of the hotel, whipped 
and frightened her; that the child had broken a cup of her 
mother’s and was so frightened that she had run away the 
evening before, had hidden for a long while somewhere
Crime and Punishment 1outside in the rain, at last had made her way in here, hid -
den behind the cupboard and spent the night there, crying 
and trembling from the damp, the darkness and the fear 
that she would be badly beaten for it. He took her in his 
arms, went back to his room, sat her on the bed, and be -
gan undressing her. The torn shoes which she had on her 
stockingless feet were as wet as if they had been standing in 
a puddle all night. When he had undressed her, he put her 
on the bed, covered her up and wrapped her in the blanket 
from her head downwards. She fell asleep at once. Then he 
sank into dreary musing again.
‘What folly to trouble myself,’ he decided suddenly with 
an oppressive feeling of annoyance. ‘What idiocy!’ In vexa -
tion he took up the candle to go and look for the ragged 
attendant again and make haste to go away. ‘Damn the child!’ 
he thought as he opened the door, but he turned again to see 
whether the child was asleep. He raised the blanket careful -
ly. The child was sleeping soundly, she had got warm under 
the blanket, and her pale cheeks were flushed. But strange 
to say that flush seemed brighter and coarser than the rosy 
cheeks of childhood. ‘It’s a flush of fever,’ thought Svidriga -
ïlov. It was like the flush from drinking, as though she had 
been given a full glass to drink. Her crimson lips were hot 
and glowing; but what was this? He suddenly fancied that 
her long black eyelashes were quivering, as though the lids 
were opening and a sly crafty eye peeped out with an un -
childlike wink, as though the little girl were not asleep, but 
pretending. Yes, it was so. Her lips parted in a smile. The 
corners of her mouth quivered, as though she were trying
1 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comto control them. But now she quite gave up all effort, now 
it was a grin, a broad grin; there was something shameless, 
provocative in that quite unchildish face; it was depravity, 
it was the face of a harlot, the shameless face of a French 
harlot. Now both eyes opened wide; they turned a glowing, 
shameless glance upon him; they laughed, invited him…. 
There was something infinitely hideous and shocking in 
that laugh, in those eyes, in such nastiness in the face of 
a child. ‘What, at five years old?’ Svidrigaïlov muttered in 
genuine horror. ‘What does it mean?’ And now she turned 
to him, her little face all aglow, holding out her arms…. ‘Ac -
cursed child!’ Svidrigaïlov cried, raising his hand to strike 
her, but at that moment he woke up.
He was in the same bed, still wrapped in the blanket. The 
candle had not been lighted, and daylight was streaming in 
at the windows.
‘I’ve had nightmare all night!’ He got up angrily, feeling 
utterly shattered; his bones ached. There was a thick mist 
outside and he could see nothing. It was nearly five. He had 
overslept himself! He got up, put on his still damp jacket 
and overcoat. Feeling the revolver in his pocket, he took it 
out and then he sat down, took a notebook out of his pocket 
and in the most conspicuous place on the title page wrote 
a few lines in large letters. Reading them over, he sank into 
thought with his elbows on the table. The revolver and the 
notebook lay beside him. Some flies woke up and settled on 
the untouched veal, which was still on the table. He stared 
at them and at last with his free right hand began trying 
to catch one. He tried till he was tired, but could not catch
Crime and Punishment 1it. At last, realising that he was engaged in this interesting 
pursuit, he started, got up and walked resolutely out of the 
room. A minute later he was in the street.
A thick milky mist hung over the town. Svidrigaïlov 
walked along the slippery dirty wooden pavement to -
wards the Little Neva. He was picturing the waters of the 
Little Neva swollen in the night, Petrovsky Island, the wet 
paths, the wet grass, the wet trees and bushes and at last the 
bush…. He began ill-humouredly staring at the houses, try -
ing to think of something else. There was not a cabman or 
a passer-by in the street. The bright yellow, wooden, little 
houses looked dirty and dejected with their closed shutters. 
The cold and damp penetrated his whole body and he be -
gan to shiver. From time to time he came across shop signs 
and read each carefully. At last he reached the end of the 
wooden pavement and came to a big stone house. A dirty, 
shivering dog crossed his path with its tail between its 
legs. A man in a greatcoat lay face downwards; dead drunk, 
across the pavement. He looked at him and went on. A high 
tower stood up on the left. ‘Bah!’ he shouted, ‘here is a place. 
Why should it be Petrovsky? It will be in the presence of an 
official witness anyway….’
He almost smiled at this new thought and turned into the 
street where there was the big house with the tower. At the 
great closed gates of the house, a little man stood with his 
shoulder leaning against them, wrapped in a grey soldier’s 
coat, with a copper Achilles helmet on his head. He cast a 
drowsy and indifferent glance at Svidrigaïlov. His face wore 
that perpetual look of peevish dejection, which is so sourly
1 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comprinted on all faces of Jewish race without exception. They 
both, Svidrigaïlov and Achilles, stared at each other for a 
few minutes without speaking. At last it struck Achilles as 
irregular for a man not drunk to be standing three steps 
from him, staring and not saying a word.
‘What do you want here?’ he said, without moving or 
changing his position.
‘Nothing, brother, good morning,’ answered Svidriga -
ïlov.
‘This isn’t the place.’
‘I am going to foreign parts, brother.’
‘To foreign parts?’
‘To America.’
‘America.’
Svidrigaïlov took out the revolver and cocked it. Achilles 
raised his eyebrows.
‘I say, this is not the place for such jokes!’
‘Why shouldn’t it be the place?’
‘Because it isn’t.’
‘Well, brother, I don’t mind that. It’s a good place. When 
you are asked, you just say he was going, he said, to Amer -
ica.’
He put the revolver to his right temple.
‘You can’t do it here, it’s not the place,’ cried Achilles, 
rousing himself, his eyes growing bigger and bigger.
Svidrigaïlov pulled the trigger.

## Chapter 6

The same day, about seven o’clock in the evening, Ras -
kolnikov was on his way to his mother’s and sister’s 
lodging—the lodging in Bakaleyev’s house which Razumi -
hin had found for them. The stairs went up from the street. 
Raskolnikov walked with lagging steps, as though still hesi -
tating whether to go or not. But nothing would have turned 
him back: his decision was taken.
‘Besides, it doesn’t matter, they still know nothing,’ he 
thought, ‘and they are used to thinking of me as eccentric.’
He was appallingly dressed: his clothes torn and dirty, 
soaked with a night’s rain. His face was almost distorted 
from fatigue, exposure, the inward conflict that had lasted 
for twenty-four hours. He had spent all the previous night 
alone, God knows where. But anyway he had reached a de -
cision.
He knocked at the door which was opened by his mother. 
Dounia was not at home. Even the servant happened to be 
out. At first Pulcheria Alexandrovna was speechless with 
joy and surprise; then she took him by the hand and drew 
him into the room.
‘Here you are!’ she began, faltering with joy. ‘Don’t be 
angry with me, Rodya, for welcoming you so foolishly with 
tears: I am laughing not crying. Did you think I was crying? 
No, I am delighted, but I’ve got into such a stupid habit of
1 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comshedding tears. I’ve been like that ever since your father’s 
death. I cry for anything. Sit down, dear boy, you must be 
tired; I see you are. Ah, how muddy you are.’
‘I was in the rain yesterday, mother….’ Raskolnikov be -
gan.
‘No, no,’ Pulcheria Alexandrovna hurriedly interrupt -
ed, ‘you thought I was going to cross-question you in the 
womanish way I used to; don’t be anxious, I understand, I 
understand it all: now I’ve learned the ways here and truly 
I see for myself that they are better. I’ve made up my mind 
once for all: how could I understand your plans and expect 
you to give an account of them? God knows what concerns 
and plans you may have, or what ideas you are hatching; 
so it’s not for me to keep nudging your elbow, asking you 
what you are thinking about? But, my goodness! why am I 
running to and fro as though I were crazy … ? I am read -
ing your article in the magazine for the third time, Rodya. 
Dmitri Prokofitch brought it to me. Directly I saw it I cried 
out to myself: ‘There, foolish one,’ I thought, ‘that’s what he 
is busy about; that’s the solution of the mystery! Learned 
people are always like that. He may have some new ideas 
in his head just now; he is thinking them over and I worry 
him and upset him.’ I read it, my dear, and of course there 
was a great deal I did not understand; but that’s only natu -
ral—how should I?’
‘Show me, mother.’
Raskolnikov took the magazine and glanced at his 
article. Incongruous as it was with his mood and his cir -
cumstances, he felt that strange and bitter sweet sensation
Crime and Punishment 1that every author experiences the first time he sees himself 
in print; besides, he was only twenty-three. It lasted only a 
moment. After reading a few lines he frowned and his heart 
throbbed with anguish. He recalled all the inward conflict 
of the preceding months. He flung the article on the table 
with disgust and anger.
‘But, however foolish I may be, Rodya, I can see for my -
self that you will very soon be one of the leading—if not the 
leading man—in the world of Russian thought. And they 
dared to think you were mad! You don’t know, but they re -
ally thought that. Ah, the despicable creatures, how could 
they understand genius! And Dounia, Dounia was all but 
believing it—what do you say to that? Your father sent twice 
to magazines—the first time poems (I’ve got the manuscript 
and will show you) and the second time a whole novel (I 
begged him to let me copy it out) and how we prayed that 
they should be taken—they weren’t! I was breaking my 
heart, Rodya, six or seven days ago over your food and your 
clothes and the way you are living. But now I see again how 
foolish I was, for you can attain any position you like by 
your intellect and talent. No doubt you don’t care about that 
for the present and you are occupied with much more im -
portant matters….’
‘Dounia’s not at home, mother?’
‘No, Rodya. I often don’t see her; she leaves me alone. 
Dmitri Prokofitch comes to see me, it’s so good of him, and 
he always talks about you. He loves you and respects you, 
my dear. I don’t say that Dounia is very wanting in consid -
eration. I am not complaining. She has her ways and I have
1 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.commine; she seems to have got some secrets of late and I never 
have any secrets from you two. Of course, I am sure that 
Dounia has far too much sense, and besides she loves you 
and me … but I don’t know what it will all lead to. You’ve 
made me so happy by coming now, Rodya, but she has 
missed you by going out; when she comes in I’ll tell her: 
‘Your brother came in while you were out. Where have you 
been all this time?’ You mustn’t spoil me, Rodya, you know; 
come when you can, but if you can’t, it doesn’t matter, I can 
wait. I shall know, anyway, that you are fond of me, that will 
be enough for me. I shall read what you write, I shall hear 
about you from everyone, and sometimes you’ll come your -
self to see me. What could be better? Here you’ve come now 
to comfort your mother, I see that.’
Here Pulcheria Alexandrovna began to cry.
‘Here I am again! Don’t mind my foolishness. My good -
ness, why am I sitting here?’ she cried, jumping up. ‘There is 
coffee and I don’t offer you any. Ah, that’s the selfishness of 
old age. I’ll get it at once!’
‘Mother, don’t trouble, I am going at once. I haven’t come 
for that. Please listen to me.’
Pulcheria Alexandrovna went up to him timidly.
‘Mother, whatever happens, whatever you hear about me, 
whatever you are told about me, will you always love me 
as you do now?’ he asked suddenly from the fullness of his 
heart, as though not thinking of his words and not weigh -
ing them.
‘Rodya, Rodya, what is the matter? How can you ask me 
such a question? Why, who will tell me anything about you?
Crime and Punishment 0Besides, I shouldn’t believe anyone, I should refuse to lis -
ten.’
‘I’ve come to assure you that I’ve always loved you and 
I am glad that we are alone, even glad Dounia is out,’ he 
went on with the same impulse. ‘I have come to tell you that 
though you will be unhappy, you must believe that your son 
loves you now more than himself, and that all you thought 
about me, that I was cruel and didn’t care about you, was 
all a mistake. I shall never cease to love you…. Well, that’s 
enough: I thought I must do this and begin with this….’
Pulcheria Alexandrovna embraced him in silence, press -
ing him to her bosom and weeping gently.
‘I don’t know what is wrong with you, Rodya,’ she said 
at last. ‘I’ve been thinking all this time that we were sim -
ply boring you and now I see that there is a great sorrow in 
store for you, and that’s why you are miserable. I’ve fore -
seen it a long time, Rodya. Forgive me for speaking about it. 
I keep thinking about it and lie awake at nights. Your sister 
lay talking in her sleep all last night, talking of nothing but 
you. I caught something, but I couldn’t make it out. I felt all 
the morning as though I were going to be hanged, waiting 
for something, expecting something, and now it has come! 
Rodya, Rodya, where are you going? You are going away 
somewhere?’
‘Yes.’
‘That’s what I thought! I can come with you, you know, 
if you need me. And Dounia, too; she loves you, she loves 
you dearly—and Sofya Semyonovna may come with us if 
you like. You see, I am glad to look upon her as a daughter Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comeven … Dmitri Prokofitch will help us to go together. But … 
where … are you going?’
‘Good-bye, mother.’
‘What, to-day?’ she cried, as though losing him for ever.
‘I can’t stay, I must go now….’
‘And can’t I come with you?’
‘No, but kneel down and pray to God for me. Your prayer 
perhaps will reach Him.’
‘Let me bless you and sign you with the cross. That’s right, 
that’s right. Oh, God, what are we doing?’
Yes, he was glad, he was very glad that there was no one 
there, that he was alone with his mother. For the first time 
after all those awful months his heart was softened. He fell 
down before her, he kissed her feet and both wept, embrac -
ing. And she was not surprised and did not question him 
this time. For some days she had realised that something 
awful was happening to her son and that now some terrible 
minute had come for him.
‘Rodya, my darling, my first born,’ she said sobbing, ‘now 
you are just as when you were little. You would run like this 
to me and hug me and kiss me. When your father was liv -
ing and we were poor, you comforted us simply by being 
with us and when I buried your father, how often we wept 
together at his grave and embraced, as now. And if I’ve been 
crying lately, it’s that my mother’s heart had a foreboding of 
trouble. The first time I saw you, that evening, you remem -
ber, as soon as we arrived here, I guessed simply from your 
eyes. My heart sank at once, and to-day when I opened the 
door and looked at you, I thought the fatal hour had come.
Crime and Punishment Rodya, Rodya, you are not going away to-day?’
‘No!’
‘You’ll come again?’
‘Yes … I’ll come.’
‘Rodya, don’t be angry, I don’t dare to question you. I 
know I mustn’t. Only say two words to me—is it far where 
you are going?’
‘Very far.’
‘What is awaiting you there? Some post or career for 
you?’
‘What God sends … only pray for me.’ Raskolnikov went 
to the door, but she clutched him and gazed despairingly 
into his eyes. Her face worked with terror.
‘Enough, mother,’ said Raskolnikov, deeply regretting 
that he had come.
‘Not for ever, it’s not yet for ever? You’ll come, you’ll 
come to-morrow?’
‘I will, I will, good-bye.’ He tore himself away at last.
It was a warm, fresh, bright evening; it had cleared up 
in the morning. Raskolnikov went to his lodgings; he made 
haste. He wanted to finish all before sunset. He did not want 
to meet anyone till then. Going up the stairs he noticed that 
Nastasya rushed from the samovar to watch him intently. 
‘Can anyone have come to see me?’ he wondered. He had 
a disgusted vision of Porfiry. But opening his door he saw 
Dounia. She was sitting alone, plunged in deep thought, 
and looked as though she had been waiting a long time. He 
stopped short in the doorway. She rose from the sofa in dis -
may and stood up facing him. Her eyes, fixed upon him, Free eBooks at Planet eBook.combetrayed horror and infinite grief. And from those eyes 
alone he saw at once that she knew.
‘Am I to come in or go away?’ he asked uncertainly.
‘I’ve been all day with Sofya Semyonovna. We were both 
waiting for you. We thought that you would be sure to come 
there.’
Raskolnikov went into the room and sank exhausted on 
a chair.
‘I feel weak, Dounia, I am very tired; and I should have 
liked at this moment to be able to control myself.’
He glanced at her mistrustfully.
‘Where were you all night?’
‘I don’t remember clearly. You see, sister, I wanted to 
make up my mind once for all, and several times I walked 
by the Neva, I remember that I wanted to end it all there, 
but … I couldn’t make up my mind,’ he whispered, looking 
at her mistrustfully again.
‘Thank God! That was just what we were afraid of, Sofya 
Semyonovna and I. Then you still have faith in life? Thank 
God, thank God!’
Raskolnikov smiled bitterly.
‘I haven’t faith, but I have just been weeping in mother’s 
arms; I haven’t faith, but I have just asked her to pray for me. 
I don’t know how it is, Dounia, I don’t understand it.’
‘Have you been at mother’s? Have you told her?’ cried 
Dounia, horror- stricken. ‘Surely you haven’t done that?’
‘No, I didn’t tell her … in words; but she understood a 
great deal. She heard you talking in your sleep. I am sure 
she half understands it already. Perhaps I did wrong in go -
Crime and Punishment ing to see her. I don’t know why I did go. I am a contemptible 
person, Dounia.’
‘A contemptible person, but ready to face suffering! You 
are, aren’t you?’
‘Yes, I am going. At once. Yes, to escape the disgrace I 
thought of drowning myself, Dounia, but as I looked into 
the water, I thought that if I had considered myself strong 
till now I’d better not be afraid of disgrace,’ he said, hurry -
ing on. ‘It’s pride, Dounia.’
‘Pride, Rodya.’
There was a gleam of fire in his lustreless eyes; he seemed 
to be glad to think that he was still proud.
‘You don’t think, sister, that I was simply afraid of the wa -
ter?’ he asked, looking into her face with a sinister smile.
‘Oh, Rodya, hush!’ cried Dounia bitterly. Silence lasted 
for two minutes. He sat with his eyes fixed on the floor; 
Dounia stood at the other end of the table and looked at 
him with anguish. Suddenly he got up.
‘It’s late, it’s time to go! I am going at once to give myself 
up. But I don’t know why I am going to give myself up.’
Big tears fell down her cheeks.
‘You are crying, sister, but can you hold out your hand 
to me?’
‘You doubted it?’
She threw her arms round him.
‘Aren’t you half expiating your crime by facing the suffer -
ing?’ she cried, holding him close and kissing him.
‘Crime? What crime?’ he cried in sudden fury. ‘That I 
killed a vile noxious insect, an old pawnbroker woman, of Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comuse to no one! … Killing her was atonement for forty sins. 
She was sucking the life out of poor people. Was that a 
crime? I am not thinking of it and I am not thinking of ex -
piating it, and why are you all rubbing it in on all sides? ‘A 
crime! a crime!’ Only now I see clearly the imbecility of my 
cowardice, now that I have decided to face this superfluous 
disgrace. It’s simply because I am contemptible and have 
nothing in me that I have decided to, perhaps too for my 
advantage, as that … Porfiry … suggested!’
‘Brother, brother, what are you saying? Why, you have 
shed blood?’ cried Dounia in despair.
‘Which all men shed,’ he put in almost frantically, ‘which 
flows and has always flowed in streams, which is spilt like 
champagne, and for which men are crowned in the Capi -
tol and are called afterwards benefactors of mankind. Look 
into it more carefully and understand it! I too wanted to do 
good to men and would have done hundreds, thousands of 
good deeds to make up for that one piece of stupidity, not 
stupidity even, simply clumsiness, for the idea was by no 
means so stupid as it seems now that it has failed…. (Ev -
erything seems stupid when it fails.) By that stupidity I only 
wanted to put myself into an independent position, to take 
the first step, to obtain means, and then everything would 
have been smoothed over by benefits immeasurable in com -
parison…. But I … I couldn’t carry out even the first step, 
because I am contemptible, that’s what’s the matter! And 
yet I won’t look at it as you do. If I had succeeded I should 
have been crowned with glory, but now I’m trapped.’
‘But that’s not so, not so! Brother, what are you saying?’
Crime and Punishment ‘Ah, it’s not picturesque, not æsthetically attractive! I fail 
to understand why bombarding people by regular siege is 
more honourable. The fear of appearances is the first symp -
tom of impotence. I’ve never, never recognised this more 
clearly than now, and I am further than ever from seeing 
that what I did was a crime. I’ve never, never been stronger 
and more convinced than now.’
The colour had rushed into his pale exhausted face, but as 
he uttered his last explanation, he happened to meet Dou -
nia’s eyes and he saw such anguish in them that he could 
not help being checked. He felt that he had, anyway, made 
these two poor women miserable, that he was, anyway, the 
cause …
‘Dounia darling, if I am guilty forgive me (though I can -
not be forgiven if I am guilty). Good-bye! We won’t dispute. 
It’s time, high time to go. Don’t follow me, I beseech you, 
I have somewhere else to go…. But you go at once and sit 
with mother. I entreat you to! It’s my last request of you. 
Don’t leave her at all; I left her in a state of anxiety, that she 
is not fit to bear; she will die or go out of her mind. Be with 
her! Razumihin will be with you. I’ve been talking to him…. 
Don’t cry about me: I’ll try to be honest and manly all my 
life, even if I am a murderer. Perhaps I shall some day make 
a name. I won’t disgrace you, you will see; I’ll still show…. 
Now good-bye for the present,’ he concluded hurriedly, no -
ticing again a strange expression in Dounia’s eyes at his last 
words and promises. ‘Why are you crying? Don’t cry, don’t 
cry: we are not parting for ever! Ah, yes! Wait a minute, I’d 
forgotten!’ Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comHe went to the table, took up a thick dusty book, opened 
it and took from between the pages a little water-colour por -
trait on ivory. It was the portrait of his landlady’s daughter, 
who had died of fever, that strange girl who had wanted to 
be a nun. For a minute he gazed at the delicate expressive 
face of his betrothed, kissed the portrait and gave it to Dou -
nia.
‘I used to talk a great deal about it to her, only to her,’ he 
said thoughtfully. ‘To her heart I confided much of what 
has since been so hideously realised. Don’t be uneasy,’ he 
returned to Dounia, ‘she was as much opposed to it as you, 
and I am glad that she is gone. The great point is that ev -
erything now is going to be different, is going to be broken 
in two,’ he cried, suddenly returning to his dejection. ‘Ev -
erything, everything, and am I prepared for it? Do I want it 
myself? They say it is necessary for me to suffer! What’s the 
object of these senseless sufferings? shall I know any bet -
ter what they are for, when I am crushed by hardships and 
idiocy, and weak as an old man after twenty years’ penal 
servitude? And what shall I have to live for then? Why am I 
consenting to that life now? Oh, I knew I was contemptible 
when I stood looking at the Neva at daybreak to-day!’
At last they both went out. It was hard for Dounia, but 
she loved him. She walked away, but after going fifty paces 
she turned round to look at him again. He was still in sight. 
At the corner he too turned and for the last time their eyes 
met; but noticing that she was looking at him, he motioned 
her away with impatience and even vexation, and turned 
the corner abruptly.
Crime and Punishment ‘I am wicked, I see that,’ he thought to himself, feeling 
ashamed a moment later of his angry gesture to Dounia. 
‘But why are they so fond of me if I don’t deserve it? Oh, if 
only I were alone and no one loved me and I too had never 
loved anyone! Nothing of all this would have happened.  But I 
wonder shall I in those fifteen or twenty years grow so meek 
that I shall humble myself before people and whimper at ev -
ery word that I am a criminal? Yes, that’s it, that’s it, that’s 
what they are sending me there for, that’s what they want. 
Look at them running to and fro about the streets, every 
one of them a scoundrel and a criminal at heart and, worse 
still, an idiot. But try to get me off and they’d be wild with 
righteous indignation. Oh, how I hate them all!’
He fell to musing by what process it could come to pass, 
that he could be humbled before all of them, indiscrimi -
nately—humbled by conviction. And yet why not? It must 
be so. Would not twenty years of continual bondage crush 
him utterly? Water wears out a stone. And why, why should 
he live after that? Why should he go now when he knew that 
it would be so? It was the hundredth time perhaps that he 
had asked himself that question since the previous evening, 
but still he went. Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comChapter VIII
When he went into Sonia’s room, it was already getting 
dark. All day Sonia had been waiting for him in ter -
rible anxiety. Dounia had been waiting with her. She had 
come to her that morning, remembering Svidrigaïlov’s 
words that Sonia knew. We will not describe the conver -
sation and tears of the two girls, and how friendly they 
became. Dounia gained one comfort at least from that in -
terview, that her brother would not be alone. He had gone 
to her, Sonia, first with his confession; he had gone to her 
for human fellowship when he needed it; she would go with 
him wherever fate might send him. Dounia did not ask, but 
she knew it was so. She looked at Sonia almost with rever -
ence and at first almost embarrassed her by it. Sonia was 
almost on the point of tears. She felt herself, on the contrary, 
hardly worthy to look at Dounia. Dounia’s gracious image 
when she had bowed to her so attentively and respectfully at 
their first meeting in Raskolnikov’s room had remained in 
her mind as one of the fairest visions of her life.
Dounia at last became impatient and, leaving Sonia, went 
to her brother’s room to await him there; she kept thinking 
that he would come there first. When she had gone, Sonia 
began to be tortured by the dread of his committing suicide, 
and Dounia too feared it. But they had spent the day trying 
to persuade each other that that could not be, and both were
Crime and Punishment 0less anxious while they were together. As soon as they part -
ed, each thought of nothing else. Sonia remembered how 
Svidrigaïlov had said to her the day before that Raskolnikov 
had two alternatives—Siberia or … Besides she knew his 
vanity, his pride and his lack of faith.
‘Is it possible that he has nothing but cowardice and fear 
of death to make him live?’ she thought at last in despair.
Meanwhile the sun was setting. Sonia was standing in 
dejection, looking intently out of the window, but from it 
she could see nothing but the unwhitewashed blank wall 
of the next house. At last when she began to feel sure of his 
death—he walked into the room.
She gave a cry of joy, but looking carefully into his face 
she turned pale.
‘Yes,’ said Raskolnikov, smiling. ‘I have come for your 
cross, Sonia. It was you told me to go to the cross-roads; 
why is it you are frightened now it’s come to that?’
Sonia gazed at him astonished. His tone seemed strange 
to her; a cold shiver ran over her, but in a moment she 
guessed that the tone and the words were a mask. He spoke 
to her looking away, as though to avoid meeting her eyes.
‘You see, Sonia, I’ve decided that it will be better so. 
There is one fact…. But it’s a long story and there’s no need 
to discuss it. But do you know what angers me? It annoys 
me that all those stupid brutish faces will be gaping at me 
directly, pestering me with their stupid questions, which 
I shall have to answer—they’ll point their fingers at me…. 
Tfoo! You know I am not going to Porfiry, I am sick of him. 
I’d rather go to my friend, the Explosive Lieutenant; how Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comI shall surprise him, what a sensation I shall make! But I 
must be cooler; I’ve become too irritable of late. You know I 
was nearly shaking my fist at my sister just now, because she 
turned to take a last look at me. It’s a brutal state to be in! 
Ah! what am I coming to! Well, where are the crosses?’
He seemed hardly to know what he was doing. He could 
not stay still or concentrate his attention on anything; his 
ideas seemed to gallop after one another, he talked incoher -
ently, his hands trembled slightly.
Without a word Sonia took out of the drawer two crosses, 
one of cypress wood and one of copper. She made the sign 
of the cross over herself and over him, and put the wooden 
cross on his neck.
‘It’s the symbol of my taking up the cross,’ he laughed. 
‘As though I had not suffered much till now! The wooden 
cross, that is the peasant one; the copper one, that is Lizave -
ta’s—you will wear yourself, show me! So she had it on … at 
that moment? I remember two things like these too, a silver 
one and a little ikon. I threw them back on the old wom -
an’s neck. Those would be appropriate now, really, those are 
what I ought to put on now…. But I am talking nonsense 
and forgetting what matters; I’m somehow forgetful…. You 
see I have come to warn you, Sonia, so that you might know 
… that’s all— that’s all I came for. But I thought I had more 
to say. You wanted me to go yourself. Well, now I am going 
to prison and you’ll have your wish. Well, what are you cry -
ing for? You too? Don’t. Leave off! Oh, how I hate it all!’
But his feeling was stirred; his heart ached, as he looked 
at her. ‘Why is she grieving too?’ he thought to himself.
Crime and Punishment ‘What am I to her? Why does she weep? Why is she looking 
after me, like my mother or Dounia? She’ll be my nurse.’
‘Cross yourself, say at least one prayer,’ Sonia begged in a 
timid broken voice.
‘Oh certainly, as much as you like! And sincerely, Sonia, 
sincerely….’
But he wanted to say something quite different.
He crossed himself several times. Sonia took up her 
shawl and put it over her head. It was the green drap de 
dames  shawl of which Marmeladov had spoken, ‘the fam -
ily shawl.’ Raskolnikov thought of that looking at it, but 
he did not ask. He began to feel himself that he was cer -
tainly forgetting things and was disgustingly agitated. He 
was frightened at this. He was suddenly struck too by the 
thought that Sonia meant to go with him.
‘What are you doing? Where are you going? Stay here, 
stay! I’ll go alone,’ he cried in cowardly vexation, and al -
most resentful, he moved towards the door. ‘What’s the use 
of going in procession?’ he muttered going out.
Sonia remained standing in the middle of the room. He 
had not even said good-bye to her; he had forgotten her. A 
poignant and rebellious doubt surged in his heart.
‘Was it right, was it right, all this?’ he thought again as 
he went down the stairs. ‘Couldn’t he stop and retract it all 
… and not go?’
But still he went. He felt suddenly once for all that he 
mustn’t ask himself questions. As he turned into the street 
he remembered that he had not said good-bye to Sonia, that 
he had left her in the middle of the room in her green shawl, Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comnot daring to stir after he had shouted at her, and he stopped 
short for a moment. At the same instant, another thought 
dawned upon him, as though it had been lying in wait to 
strike him then.
‘Why, with what object did I go to her just now? I told 
her—on business; on what business? I had no sort of busi -
ness! To tell her I was going ; but where was the need? Do I 
love her? No, no, I drove her away just now like a dog. Did I 
want her crosses? Oh, how low I’ve sunk! No, I wanted her 
tears, I wanted to see her terror, to see how her heart ached! 
I had to have something to cling to, something to delay me, 
some friendly face to see! And I dared to believe in myself, 
to dream of what I would do! I am a beggarly contemptible 
wretch, contemptible!’
He walked along the canal bank, and he had not much 
further to go. But on reaching the bridge he stopped and 
turning out of his way along it went to the Hay Market.
He looked eagerly to right and left, gazed intently at 
every object and could not fix his attention on anything; 
everything slipped away. ‘In another week, another month 
I shall be driven in a prison van over this bridge, how shall 
I look at the canal then? I should like to remember this!’ 
slipped into his mind. ‘Look at this sign! How shall I read 
those letters then? It’s written here ‘Campany,’ that’s a 
thing to remember, that letter a and to look at it again in 
a month—how shall I look at it then? What shall I be feel -
ing and thinking then? … How trivial it all must be, what 
I am fretting about now! Of course it must all be interest -
ing … in its way … (Ha-ha-ha! What am I thinking about?)
Crime and Punishment I am becoming a baby, I am showing off to myself; why am I 
ashamed? Foo! how people shove! that fat man—a German 
he must be—who pushed against me, does he know whom 
he pushed? There’s a peasant woman with a baby, begging. 
It’s curious that she thinks me happier than she is. I might 
give her something, for the incongruity of it. Here’s a five 
copeck piece left in my pocket, where did I get it? Here, here 
… take it, my good woman!’
‘God bless you,’ the beggar chanted in a lachrymose 
voice.
He went into the Hay Market. It was distasteful, very dis -
tasteful to be in a crowd, but he walked just where he saw 
most people. He would have given anything in the world to 
be alone; but he knew himself that he would not have re -
mained alone for a moment. There was a man drunk and 
disorderly in the crowd; he kept trying to dance and falling 
down. There was a ring round him. Raskolnikov squeezed 
his way through the crowd, stared for some minutes at 
the drunken man and suddenly gave a short jerky laugh. 
A minute later he had forgotten him and did not see him, 
though he still stared. He moved away at last, not remem -
bering where he was; but when he got into the middle of the 
square an emotion suddenly came over him, overwhelming 
him body and mind.
He suddenly recalled Sonia’s words, ‘Go to the cross-
roads, bow down to the people, kiss the earth, for you have 
sinned against it too, and say aloud to the whole world, ‘I 
am a murderer.’’ He trembled, remembering that. And 
the hopeless misery and anxiety of all that time, especial - Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comly of the last hours, had weighed so heavily upon him that 
he positively clutched at the chance of this new unmixed, 
complete sensation. It came over him like a fit; it was like a 
single spark kindled in his soul and spreading fire through 
him. Everything in him softened at once and the tears start -
ed into his eyes. He fell to the earth on the spot….
He knelt down in the middle of the square, bowed down 
to the earth, and kissed that filthy earth with bliss and rap -
ture. He got up and bowed down a second time.
‘He’s boozed,’ a youth near him observed.
There was a roar of laughter.
‘He’s going to Jerusalem, brothers, and saying good-bye 
to his children and his country. He’s bowing down to all 
the world and kissing the great city of St. Petersburg and its 
pavement,’ added a workman who was a little drunk.
‘Quite a young man, too!’ observed a third.
‘And a gentleman,’ someone observed soberly.
‘There’s no knowing who’s a gentleman and who isn’t 
nowadays.’
These exclamations and remarks checked Raskolnikov, 
and the words, ‘I am a murderer,’ which were perhaps on 
the point of dropping from his lips, died away. He bore 
these remarks quietly, however, and, without looking 
round, he turned down a street leading to the police office. 
He had a glimpse of something on the way which did not 
surprise him; he had felt that it must be so. The second time 
he bowed down in the Hay Market he saw, standing fifty 
paces from him on the left, Sonia. She was hiding from him 
behind one of the wooden shanties in the market-place. She
Crime and Punishment had followed him then on his painful way! Raskolnikov at 
that moment felt and knew once for all that Sonia was with 
him for ever and would follow him to the ends of the earth, 
wherever fate might take him. It wrung his heart … but he 
was just reaching the fatal place.
He went into the yard fairly resolutely. He had to mount 
to the third storey. ‘I shall be some time going up,’ he 
thought. He felt as though the fateful moment was still far 
off, as though he had plenty of time left for consideration.
Again the same rubbish, the same eggshells lying about 
on the spiral stairs, again the open doors of the flats, again 
the same kitchens and the same fumes and stench coming 
from them. Raskolnikov had not been here since that day. 
His legs were numb and gave way under him, but still they 
moved forward. He stopped for a moment to take breath, 
to collect himself, so as to enter like a man . ‘But why? what 
for?’ he wondered, reflecting. ‘If I must drink the cup what 
difference does it make? The more revolting the better.’ He 
imagined for an instant the figure of the ‘explosive lieuten -
ant,’ Ilya Petrovitch. Was he actually going to him? Couldn’t 
he go to someone else? To Nikodim Fomitch? Couldn’t he 
turn back and go straight to Nikodim Fomitch’s lodgings? 
At least then it would be done privately…. No, no! To the ‘ex -
plosive lieutenant’! If he must drink it, drink it off at once.
Turning cold and hardly conscious, he opened the door 
of the office. There were very few people in it this time—
only a house porter and a peasant. The doorkeeper did not 
even peep out from behind his screen. Raskolnikov walked 
into the next room. ‘Perhaps I still need not speak,’ passed Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comthrough his mind. Some sort of clerk not wearing a uniform 
was settling himself at a bureau to write. In a corner anoth -
er clerk was seating himself. Zametov was not there, nor, of 
course, Nikodim Fomitch.
‘No one in?’ Raskolnikov asked, addressing the person 
at the bureau.
‘Whom do you want?’
‘A-ah! Not a sound was heard, not a sight was seen, but 
I scent the Russian … how does it go on in the fairy tale … 
I’ve forgotten! ‘At your service!’’ a familiar voice cried sud -
denly.
Raskolnikov shuddered. The Explosive Lieutenant stood 
before him. He had just come in from the third room. ‘It is 
the hand of fate,’ thought Raskolnikov. ‘Why is he here?’
‘You’ve come to see us? What about?’ cried Ilya Petro -
vitch. He was obviously in an exceedingly good humour 
and perhaps a trifle exhilarated. ‘If it’s on business you are 
rather early.[*] It’s only a chance that I am here … however 
I’ll do what I can. I must admit, I … what is it, what is it? 
Excuse me….’
[*] Dostoevsky appears to have forgotten that it is after 
sunset, and that the last time Raskolnikov visited the police 
office at two in the afternoon he was reproached for coming 
too late.—TRANSLATOR.
‘Raskolnikov.’
‘Of course, Raskolnikov. You didn’t imagine I’d forgotten? 
Don’t think I am like that … Rodion Ro—Ro—Rodiono -
vitch, that’s it, isn’t it?’
‘Rodion Romanovitch.’
Crime and Punishment ‘Yes, yes, of course, Rodion Romanovitch! I was just get -
ting at it. I made many inquiries about you. I assure you I’ve 
been genuinely grieved since that … since I behaved like 
that … it was explained to me afterwards that you were a 
literary man … and a learned one too … and so to say the 
first steps … Mercy on us! What literary or scientific man 
does not begin by some originality of conduct! My wife and 
I have the greatest respect for literature, in my wife it’s a 
genuine passion! Literature and art! If only a man is a gen -
tleman, all the rest can be gained by talents, learning, good 
sense, genius. As for a hat—well, what does a hat matter? I 
can buy a hat as easily as I can a bun; but what’s under the 
hat, what the hat covers, I can’t buy that! I was even mean -
ing to come and apologise to you, but thought maybe you’d 
… But I am forgetting to ask you, is there anything you want 
really? I hear your family have come?’
‘Yes, my mother and sister.’
‘I’ve even had the honour and happiness of meeting your 
sister—a highly cultivated and charming person. I confess 
I was sorry I got so hot with you. There it is! But as for my 
looking suspiciously at your fainting fit—that affair has 
been cleared up splendidly! Bigotry and fanaticism! I un -
derstand your indignation. Perhaps you are changing your 
lodging on account of your family’s arriving?’
‘No, I only looked in … I came to ask … I thought that I 
should find Zametov here.’
‘Oh, yes! Of course, you’ve made friends, I heard. Well, 
no, Zametov is not here. Yes, we’ve lost Zametov. He’s not 
been here since yesterday … he quarrelled with everyone on Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comleaving … in the rudest way. He is a feather-headed young -
ster, that’s all; one might have expected something from 
him, but there, you know what they are, our brilliant young 
men. He wanted to go in for some examination, but it’s only 
to talk and boast about it, it will go no further than that. Of 
course it’s a very different matter with you or Mr. Razumi -
hin there, your friend. Your career is an intellectual one and 
you won’t be deterred by failure. For you, one may say, all 
the attractions of life nihil est —you are an ascetic, a monk, 
a hermit! … A book, a pen behind your ear, a learned re -
search—that’s where your spirit soars! I am the same way 
myself…. Have you read Livingstone’s Travels?’
‘No.’
‘Oh, I have. There are a great many Nihilists about nowa -
days, you know, and indeed it is not to be wondered at. What 
sort of days are they? I ask you. But we thought … you are 
not a Nihilist of course? Answer me openly, openly!’
‘N-no …’
‘Believe me, you can speak openly to me as you would to 
yourself! Official duty is one thing but … you are thinking I 
meant to say friendship  is quite another? No, you’re wrong! 
It’s not friendship, but the feeling of a man and a citizen, the 
feeling of humanity and of love for the Almighty. I may be 
an official, but I am always bound to feel myself a man and 
a citizen…. You were asking about Zametov. Zametov will 
make a scandal in the French style in a house of bad reputa -
tion, over a glass of champagne … that’s all your Zametov 
is good for! While I’m perhaps, so to speak, burning with 
devotion and lofty feelings, and besides I have rank, conse -
Crime and Punishment 0quence, a post! I am married and have children, I fulfil the 
duties of a man and a citizen, but who is he, may I ask? I ap -
peal to you as a man ennobled by education … Then these 
midwives, too, have become extraordinarily numerous.’
Raskolnikov raised his eyebrows inquiringly. The words 
of Ilya Petrovitch, who had obviously been dining, were for 
the most part a stream of empty sounds for him. But some 
of them he understood. He looked at him inquiringly, not 
knowing how it would end.
‘I mean those crop-headed wenches,’ the talkative Ilya 
Petrovitch continued. ‘Midwives is my name for them. I 
think it a very satisfactory one, ha-ha! They go to the Acad -
emy, study anatomy. If I fall ill, am I to send for a young 
lady to treat me? What do you say? Ha-ha!’ Ilya Petrovitch 
laughed, quite pleased with his own wit. ‘It’s an immoderate 
zeal for education, but once you’re educated, that’s enough. 
Why abuse it? Why insult honourable people, as that scoun -
drel Zametov does? Why did he insult me, I ask you? Look 
at these suicides, too, how common they are, you can’t fan -
cy! People spend their last halfpenny and kill themselves, 
boys and girls and old people. Only this morning we heard 
about a gentleman who had just come to town. Nil Pavlitch, 
I say, what was the name of that gentleman who shot him -
self?’
‘Svidrigaïlov,’ someone answered from the other room 
with drowsy listlessness.
Raskolnikov started.
‘Svidrigaïlov! Svidrigaïlov has shot himself!’ he cried.
‘What, do you know Svidrigaïlov?’ Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com‘Yes … I knew him…. He hadn’t been here long.’
‘Yes, that’s so. He had lost his wife, was a man of reckless 
habits and all of a sudden shot himself, and in such a shock -
ing way…. He left in his notebook a few words: that he dies 
in full possession of his faculties and that no one is to blame 
for his death. He had money, they say. How did you come 
to know him?’
‘I … was acquainted … my sister was governess in his 
family.’
‘Bah-bah-bah! Then no doubt you can tell us something 
about him. You had no suspicion?’
‘I saw him yesterday … he … was drinking wine; I knew 
nothing.’
Raskolnikov felt as though something had fallen on him 
and was stifling him.
‘You’ve turned pale again. It’s so stuffy here …’
‘Yes, I must go,’ muttered Raskolnikov. ‘Excuse my trou -
bling you….’
‘Oh, not at all, as often as you like. It’s a pleasure to see 
you and I am glad to say so.’
Ilya Petrovitch held out his hand.
‘I only wanted … I came to see Zametov.’
‘I understand, I understand, and it’s a pleasure to see 
you.’
‘I … am very glad … good-bye,’ Raskolnikov smiled.
He went out; he reeled, he was overtaken with giddiness 
and did not know what he was doing. He began going down 
the stairs, supporting himself with his right hand against 
the wall. He fancied that a porter pushed past him on his
Crime and Punishment way upstairs to the police office, that a dog in the lower 
storey kept up a shrill barking and that a woman flung a 
rolling-pin at it and shouted. He went down and out into 
the yard. There, not far from the entrance, stood Sonia, pale 
and horror- stricken. She looked wildly at him. He stood 
still before her. There was a look of poignant agony, of de -
spair, in her face. She clasped her hands. His lips worked in 
an ugly, meaningless smile. He stood still a minute, grinned 
and went back to the police office.
Ilya Petrovitch had sat down and was rummaging among 
some papers. Before him stood the same peasant who had 
pushed by on the stairs.
‘Hulloa! Back again! have you left something behind? 
What’s the matter?’
Raskolnikov, with white lips and staring eyes, came 
slowly nearer. He walked right to the table, leaned his hand 
on it, tried to say something, but could not; only incoherent 
sounds were audible.
‘You are feeling ill, a chair! Here, sit down! Some water!’
Raskolnikov dropped on to a chair, but he kept his eyes 
fixed on the face of Ilya Petrovitch, which expressed un -
pleasant surprise. Both looked at one another for a minute 
and waited. Water was brought.
‘It was I …’ began Raskolnikov.
‘Drink some water.’
Raskolnikov refused the water with his hand, and softly 
and brokenly, but distinctly said:
‘It was I killed the old pawnbroker woman and her sister 
Lizaveta with an axe and robbed them. ’ Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comIlya Petrovitch opened his mouth. People ran up on all 
sides.
Raskolnikov repeated his statement.
Crime and Punishment Epilogue Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comI
Siberia. On the banks of a broad solitary river stands a 
town, one of the administrative centres of Russia; in the 
town there is a fortress, in the fortress there is a prison. In 
the prison the second-class convict Rodion Raskolnikov 
has been confined for nine months. Almost a year and a 
half has passed since his crime.
There had been little difficulty about his trial. The crimi -
nal adhered exactly, firmly, and clearly to his statement. He 
did not confuse nor misrepresent the facts, nor soften them 
in his own interest, nor omit the smallest detail. He ex -
plained every incident of the murder, the secret of the pledge  
(the piece of wood with a strip of metal) which was found 
in the murdered woman’s hand. He described minutely how 
he had taken her keys, what they were like, as well as the 
chest and its contents; he explained the mystery of Lizave -
ta’s murder; described how Koch and, after him, the student 
knocked, and repeated all they had said to one another; 
how he afterwards had run downstairs and heard Niko -
lay and Dmitri shouting; how he had hidden in the empty 
flat and afterwards gone home. He ended by indicating the 
stone in the yard off the Voznesensky Prospect under which 
the purse and the trinkets were found. The whole thing, in 
fact, was perfectly clear. The lawyers and the judges were 
very much struck, among other things, by the fact that he
Crime and Punishment had hidden the trinkets and the purse under a stone, with -
out making use of them, and that, what was more, he did 
not now remember what the trinkets were like, or even how 
many there were. The fact that he had never opened the 
purse and did not even know how much was in it seemed 
incredible. There turned out to be in the purse three hun -
dred and seventeen roubles and sixty copecks. From being 
so long under the stone, some of the most valuable notes 
lying uppermost had suffered from the damp. They were a 
long while trying to discover why the accused man should 
tell a lie about this, when about everything else he had made 
a truthful and straightforward confession. Finally some 
of the lawyers more versed in psychology admitted that it 
was possible he had really not looked into the purse, and so 
didn’t know what was in it when he hid it under the stone. 
But they immediately drew the deduction that the crime 
could only have been committed through temporary men -
tal derangement, through homicidal mania, without object 
or the pursuit of gain. This fell in with the most recent fash -
ionable theory of temporary insanity, so often applied in 
our days in criminal cases. Moreover Raskolnikov’s hypo -
chondriacal condition was proved by many witnesses, by 
Dr. Zossimov, his former fellow students, his landlady and 
her servant. All this pointed strongly to the conclusion that 
Raskolnikov was not quite like an ordinary murderer and 
robber, but that there was another element in the case.
To the intense annoyance of those who maintained this 
opinion, the criminal scarcely attempted to defend himself. 
To the decisive question as to what motive impelled him Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comto the murder and the robbery, he answered very clearly 
with the coarsest frankness that the cause was his miser -
able position, his poverty and helplessness, and his desire 
to provide for his first steps in life by the help of the three 
thousand roubles he had reckoned on finding. He had been 
led to the murder through his shallow and cowardly nature, 
exasperated moreover by privation and failure. To the ques -
tion what led him to confess, he answered that it was his 
heartfelt repentance. All this was almost coarse….
The sentence however was more merciful than could have 
been expected, perhaps partly because the criminal had not 
tried to justify himself, but had rather shown a desire to 
exaggerate his guilt. All the strange and peculiar circum -
stances of the crime were taken into consideration. There 
could be no doubt of the abnormal and poverty-stricken 
condition of the criminal at the time. The fact that he had 
made no use of what he had stolen was put down partly to 
the effect of remorse, partly to his abnormal mental con -
dition at the time of the crime. Incidentally the murder of 
Lizaveta served indeed to confirm the last hypothesis: a man 
commits two murders and forgets that the door is open! Fi -
nally, the confession, at the very moment when the case was 
hopelessly muddled by the false evidence given by Nikolay 
through melancholy and fanaticism, and when, moreover, 
there were no proofs against the real criminal, no suspi -
cions even (Porfiry Petrovitch fully kept his word) —all 
this did much to soften the sentence. Other circumstances, 
too, in the prisoner’s favour came out quite unexpectedly. 
Razumihin somehow discovered and proved that while
Crime and Punishment Raskolnikov was at the university he had helped a poor 
consumptive fellow student and had spent his last penny 
on supporting him for six months, and when this student 
died, leaving a decrepit old father whom he had maintained 
almost from his thirteenth year, Raskolnikov had got the 
old man into a hospital and paid for his funeral when he 
died. Raskolnikov’s landlady bore witness, too, that when 
they had lived in another house at Five Corners, Raskol -
nikov had rescued two little children from a house on fire 
and was burnt in doing so. This was investigated and fairly 
well confirmed by many witnesses. These facts made an im -
pression in his favour.
And in the end the criminal was, in consideration of ex -
tenuating circumstances, condemned to penal servitude in 
the second class for a term of eight years only.
At the very beginning of the trial Raskolnikov’s moth -
er fell ill. Dounia and Razumihin found it possible to get 
her out of Petersburg during the trial. Razumihin chose a 
town on the railway not far from Petersburg, so as to be 
able to follow every step of the trial and at the same time 
to see Avdotya Romanovna as often as possible. Pulcheria 
Alexandrovna’s illness was a strange nervous one and was 
accompanied by a partial derangement of her intellect.
When Dounia returned from her last interview with her 
brother, she had found her mother already ill, in feverish 
delirium. That evening Razumihin and she agreed what 
answers they must make to her mother’s questions about 
Raskolnikov and made up a complete story for her mother’s 
benefit of his having to go away to a distant part of Russia Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comon a business commission, which would bring him in the 
end money and reputation.
But they were struck by the fact that Pulcheria Alexan -
drovna never asked them anything on the subject, neither 
then nor thereafter. On the contrary, she had her own ver -
sion of her son’s sudden departure; she told them with tears 
how he had come to say good-bye to her, hinting that she 
alone knew many mysterious and important facts, and that 
Rodya had many very powerful enemies, so that it was nec -
essary for him to be in hiding. As for his future career, she 
had no doubt that it would be brilliant when certain sinister 
influences could be removed. She assured Razumihin that 
her son would be one day a great statesman, that his article 
and brilliant literary talent proved it. This article she was 
continually reading, she even read it aloud, almost took it to 
bed with her, but scarcely asked where Rodya was, though 
the subject was obviously avoided by the others, which 
might have been enough to awaken her suspicions.
They began to be frightened at last at Pulcheria Alexan -
drovna’s strange silence on certain subjects. She did not, for 
instance, complain of getting no letters from him, though 
in previous years she had only lived on the hope of letters 
from her beloved Rodya. This was the cause of great uneasi -
ness to Dounia; the idea occurred to her that her mother 
suspected that there was something terrible in her son’s fate 
and was afraid to ask, for fear of hearing something still 
more awful. In any case, Dounia saw clearly that her mother 
was not in full possession of her faculties.
It happened once or twice, however, that Pulcheria Al -
Crime and Punishment 0exandrovna gave such a turn to the conversation that it was 
impossible to answer her without mentioning where Rodya 
was, and on receiving unsatisfactory and suspicious an -
swers she became at once gloomy and silent, and this mood 
lasted for a long time. Dounia saw at last that it was hard 
to deceive her and came to the conclusion that it was bet -
ter to be absolutely silent on certain points; but it became 
more and more evident that the poor mother suspected 
something terrible. Dounia remembered her brother’s tell -
ing her that her mother had overheard her talking in her 
sleep on the night after her interview with Svidrigaïlov and 
before the fatal day of the confession: had not she made out 
something from that? Sometimes days and even weeks of 
gloomy silence and tears would be succeeded by a period 
of hysterical animation, and the invalid would begin to talk 
almost incessantly of her son, of her hopes of his future…. 
Her fancies were sometimes very strange. They humoured 
her, pretended to agree with her (she saw perhaps that they 
were pretending), but she still went on talking.
Five months after Raskolnikov’s confession, he was sen -
tenced. Razumihin and Sonia saw him in prison as often 
as it was possible. At last the moment of separation came. 
Dounia swore to her brother that the separation should not 
be for ever, Razumihin did the same. Razumihin, in his 
youthful ardour, had firmly resolved to lay the foundations 
at least of a secure livelihood during the next three or four 
years, and saving up a certain sum, to emigrate to Siberia, a 
country rich in every natural resource and in need of work -
ers, active men and capital. There they would settle in the Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comtown where Rodya was and all together would begin a new 
life. They all wept at parting.
Raskolnikov had been very dreamy for a few days before. 
He asked a great deal about his mother and was constantly 
anxious about her. He worried so much about her that it 
alarmed Dounia. When he heard about his mother’s illness 
he became very gloomy. With Sonia he was particularly re -
served all the time. With the help of the money left to her by 
Svidrigaïlov, Sonia had long ago made her preparations to 
follow the party of convicts in which he was despatched to 
Siberia. Not a word passed between Raskolnikov and her on 
the subject, but both knew it would be so. At the final leave-
taking he smiled strangely at his sister’s and Razumihin’s 
fervent anticipations of their happy future together when 
he should come out of prison. He predicted that their moth -
er’s illness would soon have a fatal ending. Sonia and he at 
last set off.
Two months later Dounia was married to Razumihin. It 
was a quiet and sorrowful wedding; Porfiry Petrovitch and 
Zossimov were invited however. During all this period Ra -
zumihin wore an air of resolute determination. Dounia put 
implicit faith in his carrying out his plans and indeed she 
could not but believe in him. He displayed a rare strength 
of will. Among other things he began attending university 
lectures again in order to take his degree. They were contin -
ually making plans for the future; both counted on settling 
in Siberia within five years at least. Till then they rested 
their hopes on Sonia.
Pulcheria Alexandrovna was delighted to give her bless -
Crime and Punishment ing to Dounia’s marriage with Razumihin; but after the 
marriage she became even more melancholy and anxious. 
To give her pleasure Razumihin told her how Raskolnikov 
had looked after the poor student and his decrepit father 
and how a year ago he had been burnt and injured in rescu -
ing two little children from a fire. These two pieces of news 
excited Pulcheria Alexandrovna’s disordered imagination 
almost to ecstasy. She was continually talking about them, 
even entering into conversation with strangers in the street, 
though Dounia always accompanied her. In public convey -
ances and shops, wherever she could capture a listener, she 
would begin the discourse about her son, his article, how he 
had helped the student, how he had been burnt at the fire, 
and so on! Dounia did not know how to restrain her. Apart 
from the danger of her morbid excitement, there was the 
risk of someone’s recalling Raskolnikov’s name and speak -
ing of the recent trial. Pulcheria Alexandrovna found out 
the address of the mother of the two children her son had 
saved and insisted on going to see her.
At last her restlessness reached an extreme point. She 
would sometimes begin to cry suddenly and was often ill 
and feverishly delirious. One morning she declared that by 
her reckoning Rodya ought soon to be home, that she re -
membered when he said good-bye to her he said that they 
must expect him back in nine months. She began to prepare 
for his coming, began to do up her room for him, to clean 
the furniture, to wash and put up new hangings and so on. 
Dounia was anxious, but said nothing and helped her to 
arrange the room. After a fatiguing day spent in continual Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comfancies, in joyful day-dreams and tears, Pulcheria Alexan -
drovna was taken ill in the night and by morning she was 
feverish and delirious. It was brain fever. She died within a 
fortnight. In her delirium she dropped words which showed 
that she knew a great deal more about her son’s terrible fate 
than they had supposed.
For a long time Raskolnikov did not know of his moth -
er’s death, though a regular correspondence had been 
maintained from the time he reached Siberia. It was carried 
on by means of Sonia, who wrote every month to the Ra -
zumihins and received an answer with unfailing regularity. 
At first they found Sonia’s letters dry and unsatisfactory, but 
later on they came to the conclusion that the letters could 
not be better, for from these letters they received a complete 
picture of their unfortunate brother’s life. Sonia’s letters 
were full of the most matter-of-fact detail, the simplest and 
clearest description of all Raskolnikov’s surroundings as a 
convict. There was no word of her own hopes, no conjec -
ture as to the future, no description of her feelings. Instead 
of any attempt to interpret his state of mind and inner life, 
she gave the simple facts—that is, his own words, an exact 
account of his health, what he asked for at their interviews, 
what commission he gave her and so on. All these facts she 
gave with extraordinary minuteness. The picture of their 
unhappy brother stood out at last with great clearness and 
precision. There could be no mistake, because nothing was 
given but facts.
But Dounia and her husband could get little comfort out 
of the news, especially at first. Sonia wrote that he was con -
Crime and Punishment stantly sullen and not ready to talk, that he scarcely seemed 
interested in the news she gave him from their letters, that 
he sometimes asked after his mother and that when, see -
ing that he had guessed the truth, she told him at last of her 
death, she was surprised to find that he did not seem great -
ly affected by it, not externally at any rate. She told them 
that, although he seemed so wrapped up in himself and, 
as it were, shut himself off from everyone—he took a very 
direct and simple view of his new life; that he understood 
his position, expected nothing better for the time, had no 
ill-founded hopes (as is so common in his position) and 
scarcely seemed surprised at anything in his surroundings, 
so unlike anything he had known before. She wrote that 
his health was satisfactory; he did his work without shirk -
ing or seeking to do more; he was almost indifferent about 
food, but except on Sundays and holidays the food was so 
bad that at last he had been glad to accept some money from 
her, Sonia, to have his own tea every day. He begged her 
not to trouble about anything else, declaring that all this 
fuss about him only annoyed him. Sonia wrote further that 
in prison he shared the same room with the rest, that she 
had not seen the inside of their barracks, but concluded that 
they were crowded, miserable and unhealthy; that he slept 
on a plank bed with a rug under him and was unwilling to 
make any other arrangement. But that he lived so poorly 
and roughly, not from any plan or design, but simply from 
inattention and indifference.
Sonia wrote simply that he had at first shown no inter -
est in her visits, had almost been vexed with her indeed for Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comcoming, unwilling to talk and rude to her. But that in the 
end these visits had become a habit and almost a necessity 
for him, so that he was positively distressed when she was 
ill for some days and could not visit him. She used to see 
him on holidays at the prison gates or in the guard-room, 
to which he was brought for a few minutes to see her. On 
working days she would go to see him at work either at the 
workshops or at the brick kilns, or at the sheds on the banks 
of the Irtish.
About herself, Sonia wrote that she had succeeded in 
making some acquaintances in the town, that she did sew -
ing, and, as there was scarcely a dressmaker in the town, 
she was looked upon as an indispensable person in many 
houses. But she did not mention that the authorities were, 
through her, interested in Raskolnikov; that his task was 
lightened and so on.
At last the news came (Dounia had indeed noticed signs 
of alarm and uneasiness in the preceding letters) that he 
held aloof from everyone, that his fellow prisoners did not 
like him, that he kept silent for days at a time and was be -
coming very pale. In the last letter Sonia wrote that he had 
been taken very seriously ill and was in the convict ward of 
the hospital.
Crime and Punishment II
He was ill a long time. But it was not the horrors of pris -
on life, not the hard labour, the bad food, the shaven 
head, or the patched clothes that crushed him. What did he 
care for all those trials and hardships! he was even glad of 
the hard work. Physically exhausted, he could at least reck -
on on a few hours of quiet sleep. And what was the food to 
him—the thin cabbage soup with beetles floating in it? In 
the past as a student he had often not had even that. His 
clothes were warm and suited to his manner of life. He did 
not even feel the fetters. Was he ashamed of his shaven head 
and parti-coloured coat? Before whom? Before Sonia? Sonia 
was afraid of him, how could he be ashamed before her? And 
yet he was ashamed even before Sonia, whom he tortured 
because of it with his contemptuous rough manner. But it 
was not his shaven head and his fetters he was ashamed of: 
his pride had been stung to the quick. It was wounded pride 
that made him ill. Oh, how happy he would have been if 
he could have blamed himself! He could have borne any -
thing then, even shame and disgrace. But he judged himself 
severely, and his exasperated conscience found no par -
ticularly terrible fault in his past, except a simple blunder  
which might happen to anyone. He was ashamed just be -
cause he, Raskolnikov, had so hopelessly, stupidly come to 
grief through some decree of blind fate, and must humble Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comhimself and submit to ‘the idiocy’ of a sentence, if he were 
anyhow to be at peace.
Vague and objectless anxiety in the present, and in the 
future a continual sacrifice leading to nothing—that was all 
that lay before him. And what comfort was it to him that at 
the end of eight years he would only be thirty-two and able 
to begin a new life! What had he to live for? What had he to 
look forward to? Why should he strive? To live in order to 
exist? Why, he had been ready a thousand times before to 
give up existence for the sake of an idea, for a hope, even for 
a fancy. Mere existence had always been too little for him; 
he had always wanted more. Perhaps it was just because of 
the strength of his desires that he had thought himself a 
man to whom more was permissible than to others.
And if only fate would have sent him repentance—burn -
ing repentance that would have torn his heart and robbed 
him of sleep, that repentance, the awful agony of which 
brings visions of hanging or drowning! Oh, he would have 
been glad of it! Tears and agonies would at least have been 
life. But he did not repent of his crime.
At least he might have found relief in raging at his stu -
pidity, as he had raged at the grotesque blunders that had 
brought him to prison. But now in prison, in freedom  he 
thought over and criticised all his actions again and by no 
means found them so blundering and so grotesque as they 
had seemed at the fatal time.
‘In what way,’ he asked himself, ‘was my theory stupider 
than others that have swarmed and clashed from the begin -
ning of the world? One has only to look at the thing quite
Crime and Punishment independently, broadly, and uninfluenced by commonplace 
ideas, and my idea will by no means seem so … strange. 
Oh, sceptics and halfpenny philosophers, why do you halt 
half-way!’
‘Why does my action strike them as so horrible?’ he said 
to himself. ‘Is it because it was a crime? What is meant by 
crime? My conscience is at rest. Of course, it was a legal 
crime, of course, the letter of the law was broken and blood 
was shed. Well, punish me for the letter of the law … and 
that’s enough. Of course, in that case many of the benefac -
tors of mankind who snatched power for themselves instead 
of inheriting it ought to have been punished at their first 
steps. But those men succeeded and so they were right  and I 
didn’t, and so I had no right to have taken that step.’
It was only in that that he recognised his criminality, 
only in the fact that he had been unsuccessful and had con -
fessed it.
He suffered too from the question: why had he not killed 
himself? Why had he stood looking at the river and pre -
ferred to confess? Was the desire to live so strong and was 
it so hard to overcome it? Had not Svidrigaïlov overcome it, 
although he was afraid of death?
In misery he asked himself this question, and could not 
understand that, at the very time he had been standing 
looking into the river, he had perhaps been dimly conscious 
of the fundamental falsity in himself and his convictions. 
He didn’t understand that that consciousness might be the 
promise of a future crisis, of a new view of life and of his 
future resurrection. Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comHe preferred to attribute it to the dead weight of instinct 
which he could not step over, again through weakness and 
meanness. He looked at his fellow prisoners and was amazed 
to see how they all loved life and prized it. It seemed to him 
that they loved and valued life more in prison than in free -
dom. What terrible agonies and privations some of them, 
the tramps for instance, had endured! Could they care so 
much for a ray of sunshine, for the primeval forest, the cold 
spring hidden away in some unseen spot, which the tramp 
had marked three years before, and longed to see again, as 
he might to see his sweetheart, dreaming of the green grass 
round it and the bird singing in the bush? As he went on he 
saw still more inexplicable examples.
In prison, of course, there was a great deal he did not 
see and did not want to see; he lived as it were with down -
cast eyes. It was loathsome and unbearable for him to look. 
But in the end there was much that surprised him and he 
began, as it were involuntarily, to notice much that he had 
not suspected before. What surprised him most of all was 
the terrible impossible gulf that lay between him and all the 
rest. They seemed to be a different species, and he looked 
at them and they at him with distrust and hostility. He felt 
and knew the reasons of his isolation, but he would never 
have admitted till then that those reasons were so deep and 
strong. There were some Polish exiles, political prisoners, 
among them. They simply looked down upon all the rest as 
ignorant churls; but Raskolnikov could not look upon them 
like that. He saw that these ignorant men were in many re -
spects far wiser than the Poles. There were some Russians
Crime and Punishment 0who were just as contemptuous, a former officer and two 
seminarists. Raskolnikov saw their mistake as clearly. He 
was disliked and avoided by everyone; they even began to 
hate him at last—why, he could not tell. Men who had been 
far more guilty despised and laughed at his crime.
‘You’re a gentleman,’ they used to say. ‘You shouldn’t hack 
about with an axe; that’s not a gentleman’s work.’
The second week in Lent, his turn came to take the sacra -
ment with his gang. He went to church and prayed with the 
others. A quarrel broke out one day, he did not know how. 
All fell on him at once in a fury.
‘You’re an infidel! You don’t believe in God,’ they shouted. 
‘You ought to be killed.’
He had never talked to them about God nor his belief, 
but they wanted to kill him as an infidel. He said nothing. 
One of the prisoners rushed at him in a perfect frenzy. Ras -
kolnikov awaited him calmly and silently; his eyebrows did 
not quiver, his face did not flinch. The guard succeeded in 
intervening between him and his assailant, or there would 
have been bloodshed.
There was another question he could not decide: why 
were they all so fond of Sonia? She did not try to win their 
favour; she rarely met them, sometimes only she came to 
see him at work for a moment. And yet everybody knew 
her, they knew that she had come out to follow him knew 
how and where she lived. She never gave them money, did 
them no particular services. Only once at Christmas she 
sent them all presents of pies and rolls. But by degrees clos -
er relations sprang up between them and Sonia. She would Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comwrite and post letters for them to their relations. Relations 
of the prisoners who visited the town, at their instructions, 
left with Sonia presents and money for them. Their wives 
and sweethearts knew her and used to visit her. And when 
she visited Raskolnikov at work, or met a party of the pris -
oners on the road, they all took off their hats to her. ‘Little 
mother Sofya Semyonovna, you are our dear, good little 
mother,’ coarse branded criminals said to that frail little 
creature. She would smile and bow to them and everyone 
was delighted when she smiled. They even admired her gait 
and turned round to watch her walking; they admired her 
too for being so little, and, in fact, did not know what to ad -
mire her most for. They even came to her for help in their 
illnesses.
He was in the hospital from the middle of Lent till af -
ter Easter. When he was better, he remembered the dreams 
he had had while he was feverish and delirious. He dreamt 
that the whole world was condemned to a terrible new 
strange plague that had come to Europe from the depths 
of Asia. All were to be destroyed except a very few chosen. 
Some new sorts of microbes were attacking the bodies of 
men, but these microbes were endowed with intelligence 
and will. Men attacked by them became at once mad and 
furious. But never had men considered themselves so in -
tellectual and so completely in possession of the truth as 
these sufferers, never had they considered their decisions, 
their scientific conclusions, their moral convictions so in -
fallible. Whole villages, whole towns and peoples went mad 
from the infection. All were excited and did not understand
Crime and Punishment one another. Each thought that he alone had the truth and 
was wretched looking at the others, beat himself on the 
breast, wept, and wrung his hands. They did not know how 
to judge and could not agree what to consider evil and what 
good; they did not know whom to blame, whom to justi -
fy. Men killed each other in a sort of senseless spite. They 
gathered together in armies against one another, but even 
on the march the armies would begin attacking each oth -
er, the ranks would be broken and the soldiers would fall 
on each other, stabbing and cutting, biting and devouring 
each other. The alarm bell was ringing all day long in the 
towns; men rushed together, but why they were summoned 
and who was summoning them no one knew. The most or -
dinary trades were abandoned, because everyone proposed 
his own ideas, his own improvements, and they could not 
agree. The land too was abandoned. Men met in groups, 
agreed on something, swore to keep together, but at once 
began on something quite different from what they had 
proposed. They accused one another, fought and killed each 
other. There were conflagrations and famine. All men and 
all things were involved in destruction. The plague spread 
and moved further and further. Only a few men could be 
saved in the whole world. They were a pure chosen people, 
destined to found a new race and a new life, to renew and 
purify the earth, but no one had seen these men, no one had 
heard their words and their voices.
Raskolnikov was worried that this senseless dream 
haunted his memory so miserably, the impression of this 
feverish delirium persisted so long. The second week after Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comEaster had come. There were warm bright spring days; in 
the prison ward the grating windows under which the sen -
tinel paced were opened. Sonia had only been able to visit 
him twice during his illness; each time she had to obtain 
permission, and it was difficult. But she often used to come 
to the hospital yard, especially in the evening, sometimes 
only to stand a minute and look up at the windows of the 
ward.
One evening, when he was almost well again, Raskol -
nikov fell asleep. On waking up he chanced to go to the 
window, and at once saw Sonia in the distance at the hospi -
tal gate. She seemed to be waiting for someone. Something 
stabbed him to the heart at that minute. He shuddered and 
moved away from the window. Next day Sonia did not come, 
nor the day after; he noticed that he was expecting her un -
easily. At last he was discharged. On reaching the prison he 
learnt from the convicts that Sofya Semyonovna was lying 
ill at home and was unable to go out.
He was very uneasy and sent to inquire after her; he soon 
learnt that her illness was not dangerous. Hearing that he 
was anxious about her, Sonia sent him a pencilled note, tell -
ing him that she was much better, that she had a slight cold 
and that she would soon, very soon come and see him at his 
work. His heart throbbed painfully as he read it.
Again it was a warm bright day. Early in the morning, 
at six o’clock, he went off to work on the river bank, where 
they used to pound alabaster and where there was a kiln 
for baking it in a shed. There were only three of them sent. 
One of the convicts went with the guard to the fortress to
Crime and Punishment fetch a tool; the other began getting the wood ready and 
laying it in the kiln. Raskolnikov came out of the shed on 
to the river bank, sat down on a heap of logs by the shed 
and began gazing at the wide deserted river. From the high 
bank a broad landscape opened before him, the sound of 
singing floated faintly audible from the other bank. In the 
vast steppe, bathed in sunshine, he could just see, like black 
specks, the nomads’ tents. There there was freedom, there 
other men were living, utterly unlike those here; there time 
itself seemed to stand still, as though the age of Abraham 
and his flocks had not passed. Raskolnikov sat gazing, his 
thoughts passed into day-dreams, into contemplation; he 
thought of nothing, but a vague restlessness excited and 
troubled him. Suddenly he found Sonia beside him; she 
had come up noiselessly and sat down at his side. It was 
still quite early; the morning chill was still keen. She wore 
her poor old burnous and the green shawl; her face still 
showed signs of illness, it was thinner and paler. She gave 
him a joyful smile of welcome, but held out her hand with 
her usual timidity. She was always timid of holding out 
her hand to him and sometimes did not offer it at all, as 
though afraid he would repel it. He always took her hand 
as though with repugnance, always seemed vexed to meet 
her and was sometimes obstinately silent throughout her 
visit. Sometimes she trembled before him and went away 
deeply grieved. But now their hands did not part. He stole 
a rapid glance at her and dropped his eyes on the ground 
without speaking. They were alone, no one had seen them. 
The guard had turned away for the time. Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comHow it happened he did not know. But all at once some -
thing seemed to seize him and fling him at her feet. He wept 
and threw his arms round her knees. For the first instant 
she was terribly frightened and she turned pale. She jumped 
up and looked at him trembling. But at the same moment 
she understood, and a light of infinite happiness came into 
her eyes. She knew and had no doubt that he loved her be -
yond everything and that at last the moment had come….
They wanted to speak, but could not; tears stood in their 
eyes. They were both pale and thin; but those sick pale faces 
were bright with the dawn of a new future, of a full res -
urrection into a new life. They were renewed by love; the 
heart of each held infinite sources of life for the heart of the 
other.
They resolved to wait and be patient. They had another 
seven years to wait, and what terrible suffering and what 
infinite happiness before them! But he had risen again and 
he knew it and felt it in all his being, while she—she only 
lived in his life.
On the evening of the same day, when the barracks were 
locked, Raskolnikov lay on his plank bed and thought of 
her. He had even fancied that day that all the convicts who 
had been his enemies looked at him differently; he had 
even entered into talk with them and they answered him 
in a friendly way. He remembered that now, and thought 
it was bound to be so. Wasn’t everything now bound to be 
changed?
He thought of her. He remembered how continually he 
had tormented her and wounded her heart. He remembered
Crime and Punishment her pale and thin little face. But these recollections scarcely 
troubled him now; he knew with what infinite love he would 
now repay all her sufferings. And what were all, all the ago -
nies of the past! Everything, even his crime, his sentence 
and imprisonment, seemed to him now in the first rush of 
feeling an external, strange fact with which he had no con -
cern. But he could not think for long together of anything 
that evening, and he could not have analysed anything con -
sciously; he was simply feeling. Life had stepped into the 
place of theory and something quite different would work 
itself out in his mind.
Under his pillow lay the New Testament. He took it up 
mechanically. The book belonged to Sonia; it was the one 
from which she had read the raising of Lazarus to him. At 
first he was afraid that she would worry him about religion, 
would talk about the gospel and pester him with books. But 
to his great surprise she had not once approached the sub -
ject and had not even offered him the Testament. He had 
asked her for it himself not long before his illness and she 
brought him the book without a word. Till now he had not 
opened it.
He did not open it now, but one thought passed through 
his mind: ‘Can her convictions not be mine now? Her feel -
ings, her aspirations at least….’
She too had been greatly agitated that day, and at night 
she was taken ill again. But she was so happy—and so un -
expectedly happy—that she was almost frightened of her 
happiness. Seven years, only seven years! At the beginning 
of their happiness at some moments they were both ready Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comto look on those seven years as though they were seven days. 
He did not know that the new life would not be given him 
for nothing, that he would have to pay dearly for it, that it 
would cost him great striving, great suffering.
But that is the beginning of a new story—the story of the 
gradual renewal of a man, the story of his gradual regen -
eration, of his passing from one world into another, of his 
initiation into a new unknown life. That might be the sub -
ject of a new story, but our present story is ended.
